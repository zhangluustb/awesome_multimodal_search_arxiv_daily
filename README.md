| Learning Sparse Disentangled Representations for Multimodal Exclusion Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03184](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03184) | Multimodal representations are essential for cross-modal retrieval, but they often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind retrieved results. Sparse disentangled representations offer a promising solution; however, existing methods rely heavily on text tokens, resulting in high-dimensional embeddings. In this work, we propose a novel approach that generates compact, fixed-size embeddings that maintain disentanglement while providing greater control over retrieval tasks. We evaluate our method on challenging exclusion queries using the MSCOCO and Conceptual Captions benchmarks, demonstrating notable improvements over dense models like CLIP, BLIP, and VISTA (with gains of up to 11% in AP@10), as well as over sparse disentangled models like VDR (achieving up to 21% gains in AP@10). Furthermore, we present qualitative results that emphasize the enhanced interpretability of our disentangled representations. | Prachi, Sumit Bhatia, Srikanta Bedathur |
| Talk2X -- An Open-Source Toolkit Facilitating Deployment of LLM-Powered Chatbots on the Web | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03343) | Integrated into websites, LLM-powered chatbots offer alternative means of navigation and information retrieval, leading to a shift in how users access information on the web. Yet, predominantly closed-sourced solutions limit proliferation among web hosts and suffer from a lack of transparency with regard to implementation details and energy efficiency. In this work, we propose our openly available agent Talk2X leveraging an adapted retrieval-augmented generation approach (RAG) combined with an automatically generated vector database, benefiting energy efficiency. Talk2X's architecture is generalizable to arbitrary websites offering developers a ready to use tool for integration. Using a mixed-methods approach, we evaluated Talk2X's usability by tasking users to acquire specific assets from an open science repository. Talk2X significantly improved task completion time, correctness, and user experience supporting users in quickly pinpointing specific information as compared to standard user-website interaction. Our findings contribute technical advancements to an ongoing paradigm shift of how we access information on the web. | Lars Krupp, Daniel Gei{\ss}ler, Peter Hevesi, Marco Hirsch, Paul Lukowicz, Jakob Karolus |
| EnrichIndex: Using LLMs to Enrich Retrieval Indices Offline | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03598](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03598) | Existing information retrieval systems excel in cases where the language of target documents closely matches that of the user query. However, real-world retrieval systems are often required to implicitly reason whether a document is relevant. For example, when retrieving technical texts or tables, their relevance to the user query may be implied through a particular jargon or structure, rather than explicitly expressed in their content. Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential in identifying such implied relevance by leveraging their reasoning skills. Nevertheless, current LLM-augmented retrieval is hindered by high latency and computation cost, as the LLM typically computes the query-document relevance online, for every query anew. To tackle this issue we introduce EnrichIndex, a retrieval approach which instead uses the LLM offline to build semantically-enriched retrieval indices, by performing a single pass over all documents in the retrieval corpus once during ingestion time. Furthermore, the semantically-enriched indices can complement existing online retrieval approaches, boosting the performance of LLM re-rankers. We evaluated EnrichIndex on five retrieval tasks, involving passages and tables, and found that it outperforms strong online LLM-based retrieval systems, with an average improvement of 11.7 points in recall @ 10 and 10.6 points in NDCG @ 10 compared to strong baselines. In terms of online calls to the LLM, it processes 293.3 times fewer tokens which greatly reduces the online latency and cost. Overall, EnrichIndex is an effective way to build better retrieval indices offline by leveraging the strong reasoning skills of LLMs. | Peter Baile Chen, Tomer Wolfson, Michael Cafarella, Dan Roth |
| FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07030](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07030) | Multimodal multihop question answering (MMQA) requires reasoning over images and text from multiple sources. Despite advances in visual question answering, this multihop setting remains underexplored due to a lack of quality datasets. Existing methods focus on single-hop, single-modality, or short texts, limiting real-world applications like interpreting educational documents with long, multimodal content. To fill this gap, we introduce FM2DS, the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset for MMQA. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure data quality. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks: MultimodalQA and WebQA. Our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) score on average. Additionally, we introduce M2QA-Bench with 1k samples, the first benchmark for MMQA on long documents, generated using FM2DS and refined by human annotators. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating MMQA models. | Amirhossein Abaskohi, Spandana Gella, Giuseppe Carenini, Issam H. Laradji |

| MSL: Not All Tokens Are What You Need for Tuning LLM as a Recommender | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04178](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04178) | Large language models (LLMs), known for their comprehension capabilities and extensive knowledge, have been increasingly applied to recommendation systems (RS). Given the fundamental gap between the mechanism of LLMs and the requirement of RS, researchers have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with recommendation-specific data to enhance their performance. Language Modeling Loss (LML), originally designed for language generation tasks, is commonly adopted. However, we identify two critical limitations of LML: 1) it exhibits significant divergence from the recommendation objective; 2) it erroneously treats all fictitious item descriptions as negative samples, introducing misleading training signals.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel Masked Softmax Loss (MSL) tailored for fine-tuning LLMs on recommendation. MSL improves LML by identifying and masking invalid tokens that could lead to fictitious item descriptions during loss computation. This strategy can effectively avoid the interference from erroneous negative signals and ensure well alignment with the recommendation objective supported by theoretical guarantees. During implementation, we identify a potential challenge related to gradient vanishing of MSL. To overcome this, we further introduce the temperature coefficient and propose an Adaptive Temperature Strategy (ATS) that adaptively adjusts the temperature without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets further validate the effectiveness of MSL, achieving an average improvement of 42.24% in NDCG@10.

| AiReview: An Open Platform for Accelerating Systematic Reviews with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04193](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04193) | Systematic reviews are fundamental to evidence-based medicine. Creating one is time-consuming and labour-intensive, mainly due to the need to screen, or assess, many studies for inclusion in the review. Several tools have been developed to streamline this process, mostly relying on traditional machine learning methods. Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in further accelerating the screening process. However, no tool currently allows end users to directly leverage LLMs for screening or facilitates systematic and transparent usage of LLM-assisted screening methods. This paper introduces (i) an extensible framework for applying LLMs to systematic review tasks, particularly title and abstract screening, and (ii) a web-based interface for LLM-assisted screening. Together, these elements form AiReview-a novel platform for LLM-assisted systematic review creation. AiReview is the first of its kind to bridge the gap between cutting-edge LLM-assisted screening methods and those that create medical systematic reviews. The tool is available at https://aireview.ielab.io. The source code is also open sourced at https://github.com/ielab/ai-review. | Xinyu Mao, Teerapong Leelanupab, Martin Potthast, Harrisen Scells, Guido Zuccon |
| Investigating and Mitigating Stereotype-aware Unfairness in LLM-based Recommendations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04199](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04199) | Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented language understanding and reasoning capabilities to capture diverse user preferences and advance personalized recommendations. Despite the growing interest in LLM-based personalized recommendations, unique challenges are brought to the trustworthiness of LLM-based recommender systems (LLM-RS), since LLMs are likely to inherit stereotypes that are embedded ubiquitously in word embeddings due to their training on large-scale uncurated datasets. This leads to LLM-RS exhibiting stereotypical linguistic associations between users and items. However, there remains a lack of studies investigating the simultaneous existence of stereotypes between users and items in LLM-RS. To bridge this gap, this study reveals a new variant of fairness between stereotype groups containing both users and items, to quantify discrimination against stereotypes in LLM-RS. Moreover, in this paper, to mitigate stereotype-aware unfairness in textual user and item information, we propose a novel framework (MoS), in which an insightful stereotype-wise routing strategy over multiple stereotype-relevant experts is designed to learn unbiased representations against different stereotypes in LLM- RS. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of stereotype-aware fairness in LLM-RS and the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which consistently outperform competitive benchmarks under various fairness settings. | Zihuai Zhao, Wenqi Fan, Yao Wu, Qing Li |
| Decoding Recommendation Behaviors of In-Context Learning LLMs Through Gradient Descent | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04386](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04386) | Recently, there has been a growing trend in utilizing large language models (LLMs) for recommender systems, referred to as LLMRec. A notable approach within this trend is not to fine-tune these models directly but instead to leverage In-Context Learning (ICL) methods tailored for LLMRec, denoted as LLM-ICL Rec. Many contemporary techniques focus on harnessing ICL content to enhance LLMRec performance.
  However, optimizing LLMRec with ICL content presents unresolved challenges. Specifically, two key issues stand out: (1) the limited understanding of why using a few demonstrations without model fine-tuning can lead to better performance compared to zero-shot recommendations. (2) the lack of evaluation metrics for demonstrations in LLM-ICL Rec and the absence of the theoretical analysis and practical design for optimizing the generation of ICL content for recommendation contexts.
  To address these two main issues, we propose a theoretical model, the LLM-ICL Recommendation Equivalent Gradient Descent model (LRGD) in this paper, which connects recommendation generation with gradient descent dynamics. We demonstrate that the ICL inference process in LLM aligns with the training procedure of its dual model, producing token predictions equivalent to the dual model's testing outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose an evaluation metric for assessing demonstration quality. We integrate perturbations and regularizations in LRGD to enhance the robustness of the recommender system. To further improve demonstration effectiveness, prevent performance collapse, and ensure long-term adaptability, we also propose a two-stage optimization process in practice. Extensive experiments and detailed analysis on three Amazon datasets validate the theoretical equivalence and support the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and practical module design. | Yi Xu, Weicong Qin, Weijie Yu, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Jun Xu |
| Pre-training Generative Recommender with Multi-Identifier Item Tokenization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04400](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04400) | Generative recommendation autoregressively generates item identifiers to recommend potential items. Existing methods typically adopt a one-to-one mapping strategy, where each item is represented by a single identifier. However, this scheme poses issues, such as suboptimal semantic modeling for low-frequency items and limited diversity in token sequence data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MTGRec, which leverages Multi-identifier item Tokenization to augment token sequence data for Generative Recommender pre-training. Our approach involves two key innovations: multi-identifier item tokenization and curriculum recommender pre-training. For multi-identifier item tokenization, we leverage the RQ-VAE as the tokenizer backbone and treat model checkpoints from adjacent training epochs as semantically relevant tokenizers. This allows each item to be associated with multiple identifiers, enabling a single user interaction sequence to be converted into several token sequences as different data groups. For curriculum recommender pre-training, we introduce a curriculum learning scheme guided by data influence estimation, dynamically adjusting the sampling probability of each data group during recommender pre-training. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model using a single tokenizer to ensure accurate item identification for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTGRec significantly outperforms both traditional and generative recommendation baselines in terms of effectiveness and scalability. | Bowen Zheng, Enze Liu, Zhongfu Chen, Zhongrui Ma, Yue Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen |
| Universal Item Tokenization for Transferable Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04405) | Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, attracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines. | Bowen Zheng, Hongyu Lu, Yu Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen |
| COHESION: Composite Graph Convolutional Network with Dual-Stage Fusion for Multimodal Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04452](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04452) | Recent works in multimodal recommendations, which leverage diverse modal information to address data sparsity and enhance recommendation accuracy, have garnered considerable interest. Two key processes in multimodal recommendations are modality fusion and representation learning. Previous approaches in modality fusion often employ simplistic attentive or pre-defined strategies at early or late stages, failing to effectively handle irrelevant information among modalities. In representation learning, prior research has constructed heterogeneous and homogeneous graph structures encapsulating user-item, user-user, and item-item relationships to better capture user interests and item profiles. Modality fusion and representation learning were considered as two independent processes in previous work. In this paper, we reveal that these two processes are complementary and can support each other. Specifically, powerful representation learning enhances modality fusion, while effective fusion improves representation quality. Stemming from these two processes, we introduce a COmposite grapH convolutional nEtwork with dual-stage fuSION for the multimodal recommendation, named COHESION. Specifically, it introduces a dual-stage fusion strategy to reduce the impact of irrelevant information, refining all modalities using ID embedding in the early stage and fusing their representations at the late stage. It also proposes a composite graph convolutional network that utilizes user-item, user-user, and item-item graphs to extract heterogeneous and homogeneous latent relationships within users and items. Besides, it introduces a novel adaptive optimization to ensure balanced and reasonable representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of COHESION over various competitive baselines. | Jinfeng Xu, Zheyu Chen, Wei Wang, Xiping Hu, Sang-Wook Kim, Edith C.

| Can LLM-Driven Hard Negative Sampling Empower Collaborative Filtering? Findings and Potentials | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04726](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04726) | Hard negative samples can accelerate model convergence and optimize decision boundaries, which is key to improving the performance of recommender systems. Although large language models (LLMs) possess strong semantic understanding and generation capabilities, systematic research has not yet been conducted on how to generate hard negative samples effectively. To fill this gap, this paper introduces the concept of Semantic Negative Sampling and exploreshow to optimize LLMs for high-quality, hard negative sampling. Specifically, we design an experimental pipeline that includes three main modules, profile generation, semantic negative sampling, and semantic alignment, to verify the potential of LLM-driven hard negative sampling in enhancing the accuracy of collaborative filtering (CF). Experimental results indicate that hard negative samples generated based on LLMs, when semantically aligned and integrated into CF, can significantly improve CF performance, although there is still a certain gap compared to traditional negative sampling methods. Further analysis reveals that this gap primarily arises from two major challenges: noisy samples and lack of behavioral constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called HNLMRec, based on fine-tuning LLMs supervised by collaborative signals. Experimental results show that this framework outperforms traditional negative sampling and other LLM-driven recommendation methods across multiple datasets, providing new solutions for empowering traditional RS with LLMs. Additionally, we validate the excellent generalization ability of the LLM-based semantic negative sampling method on new datasets, demonstrating its potential in alleviating issues such as data sparsity, popularity bias, and the problem of false hard negative samples. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/user683/HNLMRec. | Chu Zhao, Enneng Yang, Yuting Liu, Jianzhe Zhao, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang |
| Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05181) | Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural retrieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimization toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings highlight DDRO's potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods. | Kidist Amde Mekonnen, Yubao Tang, Maarten de Rijke |
| Unleashing the Power of LLMs in Dense Retrieval with Query Likelihood Modeling | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05216](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05216) | Dense retrieval is a crucial task in Information Retrieval (IR) and is the foundation for downstream tasks such as re-ranking. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are appealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on modeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward. Inspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e., the query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs' generative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents with QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield a better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We name our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single vector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS) and Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to previous tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of tokens in the input documents during prediction. Experiments on MSMARCO show that LLM-QL can achieve significantly better performance than other LLM-based retrievers and using QL estimated by LLM-QL for ranking outperforms word-based QL by a large margin. | Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Xiaojie Sun, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng |
| LLM-Alignment Live-Streaming Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05217](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05217) | In recent years, integrated short-video and live-streaming platforms have gained massive global adoption, offering dynamic content creation and consumption. Unlike pre-recorded short videos, live-streaming enables real-time interaction between authors and users, fostering deeper engagement. However, this dynamic nature introduces a critical challenge for recommendation systems (RecSys): the same live-streaming vastly different experiences depending on when a user watching. To optimize recommendations, a RecSys must accurately interpret the real-time semantics of live content and align them with user preferences. | Yueyang Liu, Jiangxia Cao, Shen Wang, Shuang Wen, Xiang Chen, Xiangyu Wu, Shuang Yang, Zhaojie Liu, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou |
| Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220) | Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations. | Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng |
| Collab-RAG: Boosting Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Complex Question Answering via White-Box and Black-Box LLM Collaboration | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04915](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04915) | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle to handle multi-hop question-answering tasks accurately due to irrelevant context retrieval and limited complex reasoning capabilities. We introduce Collab-RAG, a collaborative training framework that leverages mutual enhancement between a white-box small language model (SLM) and a blackbox large language model (LLM) for RAG. Specifically, the SLM decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, thus enhancing the accuracy of the retrieval and facilitating more effective reasoning by the black-box LLM. Concurrently, the black-box LLM provides feedback signals to improve the SLM's decomposition capability. We observe that Collab-RAG relies solely on supervision from an affordable black-box LLM without additional distillation from frontier LLMs, yet demonstrates strong generalization across multiple black-box LLMs. Experimental evaluations across five multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Collab-RAG substantially outperforms existing black-box-only and SLM fine-tuning baselines by 1.8%-14.2% on average. In particular, our fine-tuned 3B SLM surpasses a frozen 32B LLM in question decomposition, highlighting the efficiency of Collab-RAG in improving reasoning and retrieval for complex questions. The code of Collab-RAG is available on https://github.com/ritaranx/Collab-RAG/. | Ran Xu, Wenqi Shi, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Joyce C. Ho, Haoyu Wang, Carl Yang |
| Rank-DistiLLM: Closing the Effectiveness Gap Between Cross-Encoders and LLMs for Passage Re-Ranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07920](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07920) | Cross-encoders distilled from large language models (LLMs) are often more effective re-rankers than cross-encoders fine-tuned on manually labeled data. However, distilled models do not match the effectiveness of their teacher LLMs. We hypothesize that this effectiveness gap is due to the fact that previous work has not applied the best-suited methods for fine-tuning cross-encoders on manually labeled data (e.g., hard-negative sampling, deep sampling, and listwise loss functions). To close this gap, we create a new dataset, Rank-DistiLLM. Cross-encoders trained on Rank-DistiLLM achieve the effectiveness of LLMs while being up to 173 times faster and 24 times more memory efficient. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/webis-de/ECIR-25. | Ferdinand Schlatt, Maik Fr\"obe, Harrisen Scells, Shengyao Zhuang, Bevan Koopman, Guido Zuccon, Benno Stein, Martin Potthast, Matthias Hagen |

However, we identify two critical limitations of LML: 1) it exhibits significant divergence from the recommendation objective; 2) it erroneously treats all fictitious item descriptions as negative samples, introducing misleading training signals.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel Masked Softmax Loss (MSL) tailored for fine-tuning LLMs on recommendation. MSL improves LML by identifying and masking invalid tokens that could lead to fictitious item descriptions during loss computation. This strategy can effectively avoid the interference from erroneous negative signals and ensure well alignment with the recommendation objective supported by theoretical guarantees. During implementation, we identify a potential challenge related to gradient vanishing of MSL. To overcome this, we further introduce the temperature coefficient and propose an Adaptive Temperature Strategy (ATS) that adaptively adjusts the temperature without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets further validate the effectiveness of MSL, achieving an average improvement of 42.24% in NDCG@10.

| AiReview: An Open Platform for Accelerating Systematic Reviews with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04193](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04193) | Systematic reviews are fundamental to evidence-based medicine. Creating one is time-consuming and labour-intensive, mainly due to the need to screen, or assess, many studies for inclusion in the review. Several tools have been developed to streamline this process, mostly relying on traditional machine learning methods. Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in further accelerating the screening process. However, no tool currently allows end users to directly leverage LLMs for screening or facilitates systematic and transparent usage of LLM-assisted screening methods. This paper introduces (i) an extensible framework for applying LLMs to systematic review tasks, particularly title and abstract screening, and (ii) a web-based interface for LLM-assisted screening. Together, these elements form AiReview-a novel platform for LLM-assisted systematic review creation. AiReview is the first of its kind to bridge the gap between cutting-edge LLM-assisted screening methods and those that create medical systematic reviews. The tool is available at https://aireview.ielab.io.

| Investigating and Mitigating Stereotype-aware Unfairness in LLM-based Recommendations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04199](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04199) | Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented language understanding and reasoning capabilities to capture diverse user preferences and advance personalized recommendations. Despite the growing interest in LLM-based personalized recommendations, unique challenges are brought to the trustworthiness of LLM-based recommender systems (LLM-RS), since LLMs are likely to inherit stereotypes that are embedded ubiquitously in word embeddings due to their training on large-scale uncurated datasets. This leads to LLM-RS exhibiting stereotypical linguistic associations between users and items. However, there remains a lack of studies investigating the simultaneous existence of stereotypes between users and items in LLM-RS. To bridge this gap, this study reveals a new variant of fairness between stereotype groups containing both users and items, to quantify discrimination against stereotypes in LLM-RS. Moreover, in this paper, to mitigate stereotype-aware unfairness in textual user and item information, we propose a novel framework (MoS), in which an insightful stereotype-wise routing strategy over multiple stereotype-relevant experts is designed to learn unbiased representations against different stereotypes in LLM- RS. Extensive experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of stereotype-aware fairness in LLM-RS and the effectiveness of our proposed methods, which consistently outperform competitive benchmarks under various fairness settings. | Zihuai Zhao, Wenqi Fan, Yao Wu, Qing Li |
| Decoding Recommendation Behaviors of In-Context Learning LLMs Through Gradient Descent | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04386](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04386) | Recently, there has been a growing trend in utilizing large language models (LLMs) for recommender systems, referred to as LLMRec. A notable approach within this trend is not to fine-tune these models directly but instead to leverage In-Context Learning (ICL) methods tailored for LLMRec, denoted as LLM-ICL Rec. Many contemporary techniques focus on harnessing ICL content to enhance LLMRec performance.
  However, optimizing LLMRec with ICL content presents unresolved challenges. Specifically, two key issues stand out: (1) the limited understanding of why using a few demonstrations without model fine-tuning can lead to better performance compared to zero-shot recommendations. (2) the lack of evaluation metrics for demonstrations in LLM-ICL Rec and the absence of the theoretical analysis and practical design for optimizing the generation of ICL content for recommendation contexts.
  To address these two main issues, we propose a theoretical model, the LLM-ICL Recommendation Equivalent Gradient Descent model (LRGD) in this paper, which connects recommendation generation with gradient descent dynamics. We demonstrate that the ICL inference process in LLM aligns with the training procedure of its dual model, producing token predictions equivalent to the dual model's testing outputs. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose an evaluation metric for assessing demonstration quality. We integrate perturbations and regularizations in LRGD to enhance the robustness of the recommender system. To further improve demonstration effectiveness, prevent performance collapse, and ensure long-term adaptability, we also propose a two-stage optimization process in practice. Extensive experiments and detailed analysis on three Amazon datasets validate the theoretical equivalence and support the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis and practical module design. | Yi Xu, Weicong Qin, Weijie Yu, Ming He, Jianping Fan, Jun Xu |
| Pre-training Generative Recommender with Multi-Identifier Item Tokenization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04400](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04400) | Generative recommendation autoregressively generates item identifiers to recommend potential items. Existing methods typically adopt a one-to-one mapping strategy, where each item is represented by a single identifier. However, this scheme poses issues, such as suboptimal semantic modeling for low-frequency items and limited diversity in token sequence data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MTGRec, which leverages Multi-identifier item Tokenization to augment token sequence data for Generative Recommender pre-training. Our approach involves two key innovations: multi-identifier item tokenization and curriculum recommender pre-training. For multi-identifier item tokenization, we leverage the RQ-VAE as the tokenizer backbone and treat model checkpoints from adjacent training epochs as semantically relevant tokenizers. This allows each item to be associated with multiple identifiers, enabling a single user interaction sequence to be converted into several token sequences as different data groups. For curriculum recommender pre-training, we introduce a curriculum learning scheme guided by data influence estimation, dynamically adjusting the sampling probability of each data group during recommender pre-training. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model using a single tokenizer to ensure accurate item identification for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTGRec significantly outperforms both traditional and generative recommendation baselines in terms of effectiveness and scalability. | Bowen Zheng, Enze Liu, Zhongfu Chen, Zhongrui Ma, Yue Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen |
| Universal Item Tokenization for Transferable Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04405) | Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, attracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines. | Bowen Zheng, Hongyu Lu, Yu Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen |
| COHESION: Composite Graph Convolutional Network with Dual-Stage Fusion for Multimodal Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04452](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04452) | Recent works in multimodal recommendations, which leverage diverse modal information to address data sparsity and enhance recommendation accuracy, have garnered considerable interest. Two key processes in multimodal recommendations are modality fusion and representation learning. Previous approaches in modality fusion often employ simplistic attentive or pre-defined strategies at early or late stages, failing to effectively handle irrelevant information among modalities. In representation learning, prior research has constructed heterogeneous and homogeneous graph structures encapsulating user-item, user-user, and item-item relationships to better capture user interests and item profiles. Modality fusion and representation learning were considered as two independent processes in previous work. In this paper, we reveal that these two processes are complementary and can support each other. Specifically, powerful representation learning enhances modality fusion, while effective fusion improves representation quality. Stemming from these two processes, we introduce a COmposite grapH convolutional nEtwork with dual-stage fuSION for the multimodal recommendation, named COHESION. Specifically, it introduces a dual-stage fusion strategy to reduce the impact of irrelevant information, refining all modalities using ID embedding in the early stage and fusing their representations at the late stage. It also proposes a composite graph convolutional network that utilizes user-item, user-user, and item-item graphs to extract heterogeneous and homogeneous latent relationships within users and items. Besides, it introduces a novel adaptive optimization to ensure balanced and reasonable representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of COHESION over various competitive baselines. | Jinfeng Xu, Zheyu Chen, Wei Wang, Xiping Hu, Sang-Wook Kim, Edith C.

| Can LLM-Driven Hard Negative Sampling Empower Collaborative Filtering? Findings and Potentials | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04726](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04726) | Hard negative samples can accelerate model convergence and optimize decision boundaries, which is key to improving the performance of recommender systems. Although large language models (LLMs) possess strong semantic understanding and generation capabilities, systematic research has not yet been conducted on how to generate hard negative samples effectively. To fill this gap, this paper introduces the concept of Semantic Negative Sampling and exploreshow to optimize LLMs for high-quality, hard negative sampling. Specifically, we design an experimental pipeline that includes three main modules, profile generation, semantic negative sampling, and semantic alignment, to verify the potential of LLM-driven hard negative sampling in enhancing the accuracy of collaborative filtering (CF). Experimental results indicate that hard negative samples generated based on LLMs, when semantically aligned and integrated into CF, can significantly improve CF performance, although there is still a certain gap compared to traditional negative sampling methods. Further analysis reveals that this gap primarily arises from two major challenges: noisy samples and lack of behavioral constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called HNLMRec, based on fine-tuning LLMs supervised by collaborative signals. Experimental results show that this framework outperforms traditional negative sampling and other LLM-driven recommendation methods across multiple datasets, providing new solutions for empowering traditional RS with LLMs. Additionally, we validate the excellent generalization ability of the LLM-based semantic negative sampling method on new datasets, demonstrating its potential in alleviating issues such as data sparsity, popularity bias, and the problem of false hard negative samples. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/user683/HNLMRec. | Chu Zhao, Enneng Yang, Yuting Liu, Jianzhe Zhao, Guibing Guo, Xingwei Wang |
| Lightweight and Direct Document Relevance Optimization for Generative Information Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05181) | Generative information retrieval (GenIR) is a promising neural retrieval paradigm that formulates document retrieval as a document identifier (docid) generation task, allowing for end-to-end optimization toward a unified global retrieval objective. However, existing GenIR models suffer from token-level misalignment, where models trained to predict the next token often fail to capture document-level relevance effectively. While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions. These findings highlight DDRO's potential to enhance retrieval effectiveness with a simplified optimization approach. By framing alignment as a direct optimization problem, DDRO simplifies the ranking optimization pipeline of GenIR models while offering a viable alternative to reinforcement learning-based methods. | Kidist Amde Mekonnen, Yubao Tang, Maarten de Rijke |
| Unleashing the Power of LLMs in Dense Retrieval with Query Likelihood Modeling | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05216](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05216) | Dense retrieval is a crucial task in Information Retrieval (IR) and is the foundation for downstream tasks such as re-ranking. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are appealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on modeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward. Inspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e., the query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs' generative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents with QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield a better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We name our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single vector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS) and Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to previous tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of tokens in the input documents during prediction. Experiments on MSMARCO show that LLM-QL can achieve significantly better performance than other LLM-based retrievers and using QL estimated by LLM-QL for ranking outperforms word-based QL by a large margin. | Hengran Zhang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Xiaojie Sun, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng |
| LLM-Alignment Live-Streaming Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05217](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05217) | In recent years, integrated short-video and live-streaming platforms have gained massive global adoption, offering dynamic content creation and consumption. Unlike pre-recorded short videos, live-streaming enables real-time interaction between authors and users, fostering deeper engagement. However, this dynamic nature introduces a critical challenge for recommendation systems (RecSys): the same live-streaming vastly different experiences depending on when a user watching. To optimize recommendations, a RecSys must accurately interpret the real-time semantics of live content and align them with user preferences. | Yueyang Liu, Jiangxia Cao, Shen Wang, Shuang Wen, Xiang Chen, Xiangyu Wu, Shuang Yang, Zhaojie Liu, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou |
| Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220) | Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations. | Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng |
| Collab-RAG: Boosting Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Complex Question Answering via White-Box and Black-Box LLM Collaboration | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04915](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04915) | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle to handle multi-hop question-answering tasks accurately due to irrelevant context retrieval and limited complex reasoning capabilities. We introduce Collab-RAG, a collaborative training framework that leverages mutual enhancement between a white-box small language model (SLM) and a blackbox large language model (LLM) for RAG. Specifically, the SLM decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, thus enhancing the accuracy of the retrieval and facilitating more effective reasoning by the black-box LLM. Concurrently, the black-box LLM provides feedback signals to improve the SLM's decomposition capability. We observe that Collab-RAG relies solely on supervision from an affordable black-box LLM without additional distillation from frontier LLMs, yet demonstrates strong generalization across multiple black-box LLMs. Experimental evaluations across five multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Collab-RAG substantially outperforms existing black-box-only and SLM fine-tuning baselines by 1.8%-14.2% on average. In particular, our fine-tuned 3B SLM surpasses a frozen 32B LLM in question decomposition, highlighting the efficiency of Collab-RAG in improving reasoning and retrieval for complex questions. The code of Collab-RAG is available on https://github.com/ritaranx/Collab-RAG/. | Ran Xu, Wenqi Shi, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Joyce C. Ho, Haoyu Wang, Carl Yang |
| Rank-DistiLLM: Closing the Effectiveness Gap Between Cross-Encoders and LLMs for Passage Re-Ranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07920](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07920) | Cross-encoders distilled from large language models (LLMs) are often more effective re-rankers than cross-encoders fine-tuned on manually labeled data. However, distilled models do not match the effectiveness of their teacher LLMs. We hypothesize that this effectiveness gap is due to the fact that previous work has not applied the best-suited methods for fine-tuning cross-encoders on manually labeled data (e.g., hard-negative sampling, deep sampling, and listwise loss functions). To close this gap, we create a new dataset, Rank-DistiLLM. Cross-encoders trained on Rank-DistiLLM achieve the effectiveness of LLMs while being up to 173 times faster and 24 times more memory efficient. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/webis-de/ECIR-25. | Ferdinand Schlatt, Maik Fr\"obe, Harrisen Scells, Shengyao Zhuang, Bevan Koopman, Guido Zuccon, Benno Stein, Martin Potthast, Matthias Hagen |
| IterQR: An Iterative Framework for LLM-based Query Rewrite in e-Commercial Search System | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05309) | The essence of modern e-Commercial search system lies in matching user's intent and available candidates depending on user's query, providing personalized and precise service. However, user's query may be incorrect due to ambiguous input and typo, leading to inaccurate search. These cases may be released by query rewrite: modify query to other representation or expansion. However, traditional query rewrite replies on static rewrite vocabulary, which is manually established meanwhile lacks interaction with both domain knowledge in e-Commercial system and common knowledge in the real world. In this paper, with the ability to generate text content of Large Language Models (LLMs), we provide an iterative framework to generate query rewrite. The framework incorporates a 3-stage procedure in each iteration: Rewrite Generation with domain knowledge by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and query understanding by Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT); Online Signal Collection with automatic positive rewrite update; Post-training of LLM with multi task objective to generate new rewrites. Our work (named as IterQR) provides a comprehensive framework to generate \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{R}ewrite with both domain / real-world knowledge. It automatically update and self-correct the rewrites during \textbf{iter}ations. \method{} has been deployed in Meituan Delivery's search system (China's leading food delivery platform), providing service for users with significant improvement. | Shangyu Chen, Xinyu Jia, Yingfei Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Xiang Li, Wei Lin |
| Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05314](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05314) | Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates. Most existing methods attempt to leverage prior knowledge embedded in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to improve the recommendation performance. However, they often fail to accommodate the differences between the general linguistic knowledge of PLMs and the specific needs of recommendation systems. Moreover, they rarely consider the complementary knowledge between the multimodal information of items, which represents the multi-faceted preferences of users. To facilitate efficient recommendation knowledge transfer, we propose a novel approach called Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation (MQL4GRec). Our key idea is to transform items from different domains and modalities into a unified language, which can serve as a bridge for transferring recommendation knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce quantitative translators to convert the text and image content of items from various domains into a new and concise language, known as quantitative language, with all items sharing the same vocabulary. Then, we design a series of quantitative language generation tasks to enrich quantitative language with semantic information and prior knowledge. Finally, we achieve the transfer of recommendation knowledge from different domains and modalities to the recommendation task through pre-training and fine-tuning. We evaluate the effectiveness of MQL4GRec through extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods, achieving improvements over the baseline by 11.18\%, 14.82\%, and 7.95\% on the NDCG metric across three different datasets, respectively. | Jianyang Zhai, Zi-Feng Mai, Chang-Dong Wang, Feidiao Yang, Xiawu Zheng, Hui Li, Yonghong Tian |
| User Feedback Alignment for LLM-powered Exploration in Large-scale Recommendation Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05522](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05522) | Exploration, the act of broadening user experiences beyond their established preferences, is challenging in large-scale recommendation systems due to feedback loops and limited signals on user exploration patterns. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential by leveraging their world knowledge to recommend novel content outside these loops. A key challenge is aligning LLMs with user preferences while preserving their knowledge and reasoning. While using LLMs to plan for the next novel user interest, this paper introduces a novel approach combining hierarchical planning with LLM inference-time scaling to improve recommendation relevancy without compromising novelty. We decouple novelty and user-alignment, training separate LLMs for each objective. We then scale up the novelty-focused LLM's inference and select the best-of-n predictions using the user-aligned LLM. Live experiments demonstrate efficacy, showing significant gains in both user satisfaction (measured by watch activity and active user counts) and exploration diversity. | Jianling Wang, Yifan Liu, Yinghao Sun, Xuejian Ma, Yueqi Wang, He Ma, Steven Su, Ed H.

| Unified Generative Search and Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05730) | Modern commercial platforms typically offer both search and recommendation functionalities to serve diverse user needs, making joint modeling of these tasks an appealing direction. While prior work has shown that integrating search and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a performance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of the other. This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements: search emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas recommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items. Effectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1) integrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations, and (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of search and recommendation. The emergence of generative retrieval with Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities. This paradigm encodes items as identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential generation tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and task-specific prompts. In light of this, we introduce GenSAR, a unified generative framework for balanced search and recommendation. Our approach designs dual-purpose identifiers and tailored training strategies to incorporate complementary signals and align with task-specific objectives. Experiments on both public and commercial datasets demonstrate that GenSAR effectively reduces the trade-off and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks. | Teng Shi, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Enyun Yu |
| StealthRank: LLM Ranking Manipulation via Stealthy Prompt Optimization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05804](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05804) | The integration of large language models (LLMs) into information retrieval systems introduces new attack surfaces, particularly for adversarial ranking manipulations. We present StealthRank, a novel adversarial ranking attack that manipulates LLM-driven product recommendation systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within product descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target products while avoiding explicit manipulation traces that can be easily detected. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven recommendation systems. | Yiming Tang, Yi Fan, Chenxiao Yu, Tiankai Yang, Yue Zhao, Xiyang Hu |
| Automated Archival Descriptions with Federated Intelligence of LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05711) | Enforcing archival standards requires specialized expertise, and manually creating metadata descriptions for archival materials is a tedious and error-prone task. This work aims at exploring the potential of agentic AI and large language models (LLMs) in addressing the challenges of implementing a standardized archival description process. To this end, we introduce an agentic AI-driven system for automated generation of high-quality metadata descriptions of archival materials. We develop a federated optimization approach that unites the intelligence of multiple LLMs to construct optimal archival metadata. We also suggest methods to overcome the challenges associated with using LLMs for consistent metadata generation. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our techniques, we conducted extensive experiments using a real-world dataset of archival materials, which covers a variety of document types and data formats. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques and highlight the superior performance of the federated optimization approach compared to single-model solutions in metadata quality and reliability. | Jinghua Groppe, Andreas Marquet, Annabel Walz, Sven Groppe |
| Are Generative AI Agents Effective Personalized Financial Advisors? | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05862](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05862) | Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations. But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice. | Takehiro Takayanagi, Kiyoshi Izumi, Javier Sanz-Cruzado, Richard McCreadie, Iadh Ounis |
| Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220) | Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations. | Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng |
| Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09516) | Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

| RAVEN: An Agentic Framework for Multimodal Entity Discovery from Large-Scale Video Collections | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06272](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06272) | We present RAVEN an adaptive AI agent framework designed for multimodal entity discovery and retrieval in large-scale video collections. Synthesizing information across visual, audio, and textual modalities, RAVEN autonomously processes video data to produce structured, actionable representations for downstream tasks. Key contributions include (1) a category understanding step to infer video themes and general-purpose entities, (2) a schema generation mechanism that dynamically defines domain-specific entities and attributes, and (3) a rich entity extraction process that leverages semantic retrieval and schema-guided prompting. RAVEN is designed to be model-agnostic, allowing the integration of different vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) based on application-specific requirements. This flexibility supports diverse applications in personalized search, content discovery, and scalable information retrieval, enabling practical applications across vast datasets. | Kevin Dela Rosa |
| DiffusionCom: Structure-Aware Multimodal Diffusion Model for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06543) | Most current MKGC approaches are predominantly based on discriminative models that maximize conditional likelihood. These approaches struggle to efficiently capture the complex connections in real-world knowledge graphs, thereby limiting their overall performance. To address this issue, we propose a structure-aware multimodal Diffusion model for multimodal knowledge graph Completion (DiffusionCom). DiffusionCom innovatively approaches the problem from the perspective of generative models, modeling the association between the $(head, relation)$ pair and candidate tail entities as their joint probability distribution $p((head, relation), (tail))$, and framing the MKGC task as a process of gradually generating the joint probability distribution from noise. Furthermore, to fully leverage the structural information in MKGs, we propose Structure-MKGformer, an adaptive and structure-aware multimodal knowledge representation learning method, as the encoder for DiffusionCom. Structure-MKGformer captures rich structural information through a multimodal graph attention network (MGAT) and adaptively fuses it with entity representations, thereby enhancing the structural awareness of these representations. This design effectively addresses the limitations of existing MKGC methods, particularly those based on multimodal pre-trained models, in utilizing structural information. DiffusionCom is trained using both generative and discriminative losses for the generator, while the feature extractor is optimized exclusively with discriminative loss. This dual approach allows DiffusionCom to harness the strengths of both generative and discriminative models. Extensive experiments on the FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG datasets demonstrate that DiffusionCom outperforms state-of-the-art models. | Wei Huang, Meiyu Liang, Peining Li, Xu Hou, Yawen Li, Junping Du, Zhe Xue, Zeli Guan |
| BBQRec: Behavior-Bind Quantization for Multi-Modal Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06636](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06636) | Multi-modal sequential recommendation systems leverage auxiliary signals (e.g., text, images) to alleviate data sparsity in user-item interactions. While recent methods exploit large language models to encode modalities into discrete semantic IDs for autoregressive prediction, we identify two critical limitations: (1) Existing approaches adopt fragmented quantization, where modalities are independently mapped to semantic spaces misaligned with behavioral objectives, and (2) Over-reliance on semantic IDs disrupts inter-modal semantic coherence, thereby weakening the expressive power of multi-modal representations for modeling diverse user preferences.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Behavior-Bind multi-modal Quantization for Sequential Recommendation (BBQRec for short) featuring dual-aligned quantization and semantics-aware sequence modeling. First, our behavior-semantic alignment module disentangles modality-agnostic behavioral patterns from noisy modality-specific features through contrastive codebook learning, ensuring semantic IDs are inherently tied to recommendation tasks. Second, we design a discretized similarity reweighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts self-attention scores using quantized semantic relationships, preserving multi-modal synergies while avoiding invasive modifications to the sequence modeling architecture. Extensive evaluations across four real-world benchmarks demonstrate BBQRec's superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines. | Kaiyuan Li, Rui Xiang, Yong Bai, Yongxiang Tang, Yanhua Cheng, Xialong Liu, Peng Jiang, Kun Gai |
| Toward Holistic Evaluation of Recommender Systems Powered by Generative Models | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06667](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06667) | Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring effective personalization and responsible deployment. | Yashar Deldjoo, Nikhil Mehta, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, Shuai Zhang, Pablo Castells, Julian McAuley |
| Unifying Search and Recommendation: A Generative Paradigm Inspired by Information Theory | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06714](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06714) | Recommender systems and search engines serve as foundational elements of online platforms, with the former delivering information proactively and the latter enabling users to seek information actively. Unifying both tasks in a shared model is promising since it can enhance user modeling and item understanding. Previous approaches mainly follow a discriminative paradigm, utilizing shared encoders to process input features and task-specific heads to perform each task. However, this paradigm encounters two key challenges: gradient conflict and manual design complexity. From the information theory perspective, these challenges potentially both stem from the same issue -- low mutual information between the input features and task-specific outputs during the optimization process.
  To tackle these issues, we propose GenSR, a novel generative paradigm for unifying search and recommendation (S&amp;R), which leverages task-specific prompts to partition the model's parameter space into subspaces, thereby enhancing mutual information. To construct effective subspaces for each task, GenSR first prepares informative representations for each subspace and then optimizes both subspaces in one unified model. Specifically, GenSR consists of two main modules: (1) Dual Representation Learning, which independently models collaborative and semantic historical information to derive expressive item representations; and (2) S&amp;R Task Unifying, which utilizes contrastive learning together with instruction tuning to generate task-specific outputs effectively. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show GenSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across S&amp;R tasks. Our work introduces a new generative paradigm compared with previous discriminative methods and establishes its superiority from the mutual information perspective. | Jujia Zhao, Wenjie Wang, Chen Xu, Xiuying Wang, Zhaochun Ren, Suzan Verberne |
| KG-LLM-Bench: A Scalable Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Reasoning on Textualized Knowledge Graphs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07087](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07087) | Knowledge graphs have emerged as a popular method for injecting up-to-date, factual knowledge into large language models (LLMs). This is typically achieved by converting the knowledge graph into text that the LLM can process in context. While multiple methods of encoding knowledge graphs have been proposed, the impact of this textualization process on LLM performance remains under-explored. We introduce KG-LLM-Bench, a comprehensive and extensible benchmark spanning five knowledge graph understanding tasks, and evaluate how different encoding strategies affect performance across various base models. Our extensive experiments with seven language models and five textualization strategies provide insights for optimizing LLM performance on KG reasoning tasks. | Elan Markowitz, Krupa Galiya, Greg Ver Steeg, Aram Galstyan |
| ELOQ: Resources for Enhancing LLM Detection of Out-of-Scope Questions | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14567) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in Conversational AI systems to generate responses to user inquiries. However, many natural questions lack well-defined answers. While existing studies primarily focus on question types such as false premises, they often overlook out-of-scope questions, where the provided document is semantically highly similar to the query but does not contain the required answer. In this paper, we propose a guided hallucination-based method to efficiently generate a diverse set of out-of-scope questions from a given document corpus. We then evaluate multiple LLMs based on their effectiveness in confusion detection and appropriate response generation. Furthermore, we introduce an improved method for detecting such out-of-scope questions, enhancing the reliability of LLM-based question-answering systems. | Zhiyuan Peng, Jinming Nian, Alexandre Evfimievski, Yi Fang |
| DashCLIP: Leveraging multimodal models for generating semantic embeddings for DoorDash | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07110](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07110) | Despite the success of vision-language models in various generative tasks, obtaining high-quality semantic representations for products and user intents is still challenging due to the inability of off-the-shelf models to capture nuanced relationships between the entities. In this paper, we introduce a joint training framework for product and user queries by aligning uni-modal and multi-modal encoders through contrastive learning on image-text data. Our novel approach trains a query encoder with an LLM-curated relevance dataset, eliminating the reliance on engagement history. These embeddings demonstrate strong generalization capabilities and improve performance across applications, including product categorization and relevance prediction. For personalized ads recommendation, a significant uplift in the click-through rate and conversion rate after the deployment further confirms the impact on key business metrics. We believe that the flexibility of our framework makes it a promising solution toward enriching the user experience across the e-commerce landscape. | Omkar Gurjar, Kin Sum Liu, Praveen Kolli, Utsaw Kumar, Mandar Rahurkar |
| Towards Distribution Matching between Collaborative and Language Spaces for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07363](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07363) | Generative recommendation aims to learn the underlying generative process over the entire item set to produce recommendations for users. Although it leverages non-linear probabilistic models to surpass the limited modeling capacity of linear factor models, it is often constrained by a trade-off between representation ability and tractability. With the rise of a new generation of generative methods based on pre-trained language models (LMs), incorporating LMs into general recommendation with implicit feedback has gained considerable attention. However, adapting them to generative recommendation remains challenging. The core reason lies in the mismatch between the input-output formats and semantics of generative models and LMs, making it challenging to achieve optimal alignment in the feature space. This work addresses this issue by proposing a model-agnostic generative recommendation framework called DMRec, which introduces a probabilistic meta-network to bridge the outputs of LMs with user interactions, thereby enabling an equivalent probabilistic modeling process. Subsequently, we design three cross-space distribution matching processes aimed at maximizing shared information while preserving the unique semantics of each space and filtering out irrelevant information. We apply DMRec to three different types of generative recommendation methods and conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DMRec can effectively enhance the recommendation performance of these generative models, and it shows significant advantages over mainstream LM-enhanced recommendation methods. | Yi Zhang, Yiwen Zhang, Yu Wang, Tong Chen, Hongzhi Yin |
| LLM4Ranking: An Easy-to-use Framework of Utilizing Large Language Models for Document Reranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07439) | Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for document reranking has been a popular and promising research direction in recent years, many studies are dedicated to improving the performance and efficiency of using LLMs for reranking. Besides, it can also be applied in many real-world applications, such as search engines or retrieval-augmented generation. In response to the growing demand for research and application in practice, we introduce a unified framework, \textbf{LLM4Ranking}, which enables users to adopt different ranking methods using open-source or closed-source API-based LLMs. Our framework provides a simple and extensible interface for document reranking with LLMs, as well as easy-to-use evaluation and fine-tuning scripts for this task. We conducted experiments based on this framework and evaluated various models and methods on several widely used datasets, providing reproducibility results on utilizing LLMs for document reranking.

| CollEX -- A Multimodal Agentic RAG System Enabling Interactive Exploration of Scientific Collections | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07643](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07643) | In this paper, we introduce CollEx, an innovative multimodal agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to enhance interactive exploration of extensive scientific collections. Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university. | Florian Schneider, Narges Baba Ahmadi, Niloufar Baba Ahmadi, Iris Vogel, Martin Semmann, Chris Biemann |
| FairEval: Evaluating Fairness in LLM-Based Recommendations with Personality Awareness | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07801) | Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their application to recommender systems (RecLLMs), yet concerns remain regarding fairness across demographic and psychological user dimensions. We introduce FairEval, a novel evaluation framework to systematically assess fairness in LLM-based recommendations. FairEval integrates personality traits with eight sensitive demographic attributes,including gender, race, and age, enabling a comprehensive assessment of user-level bias. We evaluate models, including ChatGPT 4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash, on music and movie recommendations. FairEval's fairness metric, PAFS, achieves scores up to 0.9969 for ChatGPT 4o and 0.9997 for Gemini 1.5 Flash, with disparities reaching 34.79 percent. These results highlight the importance of robustness in prompt sensitivity and support more inclusive recommendation systems. | Chandan Kumar Sah, Xiaoli Lian, Tony Xu, Li Zhang |
| Unified Generative Search and Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05730) | Modern commercial platforms typically offer both search and recommendation functionalities to serve diverse user needs, making joint modeling of these tasks an appealing direction. While prior work has shown that integrating search and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a performance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of the other. This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements: search emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas recommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items. Effectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1) integrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations, and (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of search and recommendation. The emergence of generative retrieval with Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities. This paradigm encodes items as identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential generation tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and task-specific prompts. In light of this, we introduce GenSAR, a unified generative framework for balanced search and recommendation. Our approach designs dual-purpose identifiers and tailored training strategies to incorporate complementary signals and align with task-specific objectives. Experiments on both public and commercial datasets demonstrate that GenSAR effectively reduces the trade-off and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks. | Teng Shi, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Enyun Yu |
| ArxivBench: Can LLMs Assist Researchers in Conducting Research? | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10496](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10496) | Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in completing various tasks such as reasoning, translation, and question answering. However the issue of factual incorrect content in LLM-generated responses remains a persistent challenge. In this study, we evaluate both proprietary and open-source LLMs on their ability to respond with relevant research papers and accurate links to articles hosted on the arXiv platform, based on high level prompts. To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce arXivBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLM performance across eight major subject categories on arXiv and five subfields within computer science, one of the most popular categories among them. Our findings reveal a concerning accuracy of LLM-generated responses depending on the subject, with some subjects experiencing significantly lower accuracy than others. Notably, Claude-3.5-Sonnet exhibits a substantial advantage in generating both relevant and accurate responses. And interestingly, most LLMs achieve a much higher accuracy in the Artificial Intelligence sub-field than other sub-fields. This benchmark provides a standardized tool for evaluating the reliability of LLM-generated scientific responses, promoting more dependable use of LLMs in academic and research environments. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/arxivBenchLLM/arXivBench and our dataset is available on huggingface at https://huggingface.co/datasets/arXivBenchLLM/arXivBench. | Ning Li, Jingran Zhang, Justin Cui |
| Exploring Generative AI Techniques in Government: A Case Study | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10497](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10497) | The swift progress of Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this paper presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers. | Sunyi Liu, Mengzhe Geng, Rebecca Hart |
| Leveraging Auto-Distillation and Generative Self-Supervised Learning in Residual Graph Transformers for Enhanced Recommender Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10500](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10500) | This paper introduces a cutting-edge method for enhancing recommender systems through the integration of generative self-supervised learning (SSL) with a Residual Graph Transformer. Our approach emphasizes the importance of superior data enhancement through the use of pertinent pretext tasks, automated through rationale-aware SSL to distill clear ways of how users and items interact. The Residual Graph Transformer incorporates a topology-aware transformer for global context and employs residual connections to improve graph representation learning. Additionally, an auto-distillation process refines self-supervised signals to uncover consistent collaborative rationales. Experimental evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods. | Eya Mhedhbi, Youssef Mourchid, Alice Othmani |
| PinRec: Outcome-Conditioned, Multi-Token Generative Retrieval for Industry-Scale Recommendation Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10507](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10507) | Generative retrieval methods utilize generative sequential modeling techniques, such as transformers, to generate candidate items for recommender systems. These methods have demonstrated promising results in academic benchmarks, surpassing traditional retrieval models like two-tower architectures. However, current generative retrieval methods lack the scalability required for industrial recommender systems, and they are insufficiently flexible to satisfy the multiple metric requirements of modern systems.
  This paper introduces PinRec, a novel generative retrieval model developed for applications at Pinterest. PinRec utilizes outcome-conditioned generation, enabling modelers to specify how to balance various outcome metrics, such as the number of saves and clicks, to effectively align with business goals and user exploration. Additionally, PinRec incorporates multi-token generation to enhance output diversity while optimizing generation. Our experiments demonstrate that PinRec can successfully balance performance, diversity, and efficiency, delivering a significant positive impact to users using generative models. This paper marks a significant milestone in generative retrieval, as it presents, to our knowledge, the first rigorous study on implementing generative retrieval at the scale of Pinterest. | Anirudhan Badrinath, Prabhat Agarwal, Laksh Bhasin, Jaewon Yang, Jiajing Xu, Charles Rosenberg |
| Beyond Reproducibility: Advancing Zero-shot LLM Reranking Efficiency with Setwise Insertion | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10509) | This study presents a comprehensive reproducibility and extension analysis of the Setwise prompting methodology for zero-shot ranking with Large Language Models (LLMs), as proposed by Zhuang et al. We evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency compared to traditional Pointwise, Pairwise, and Listwise approaches in document ranking tasks. Our reproduction confirms the findings of Zhuang et al., highlighting the trade-offs between computational efficiency and ranking effectiveness in Setwise methods. Building on these insights, we introduce Setwise Insertion, a novel approach that leverages the initial document ranking as prior knowledge, reducing unnecessary comparisons and uncertainty by focusing on candidates more likely to improve the ranking results. Experimental results across multiple LLM architectures (Flan-T5, Vicuna, and Llama) show that Setwise Insertion yields a 31% reduction in query time, a 23% reduction in model inferences, and a slight improvement in reranking effectiveness compared to the original Setwise method. These findings highlight the practical advantage of incorporating prior ranking knowledge into Setwise prompting for efficient and accurate zero-shot document reranking. | Jakub Podolak, Leon Peric, Mina Janicijevic, Roxana Petcu |
| Distilling Transitional Pattern to Large Language Models for Multimodal Session-based Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10538](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10538) | Session-based recommendation (SBR) predicts the next item based on anonymous sessions. Traditional SBR explores user intents based on ID collaborations or auxiliary content. To further alleviate data sparsity and cold-start issues, recent Multimodal SBR (MSBR) methods utilize simplistic pre-trained models for modality learning but have limitations in semantic richness. Considering semantic reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLM), we focus on the LLM-enhanced MSBR scenario in this paper, which leverages LLM cognition for comprehensive multimodal representation generation, to enhance downstream MSBR. Tackling this problem faces two challenges: i) how to obtain LLM cognition on both transitional patterns and inherent multimodal knowledge, ii) how to align both features into one unified LLM, minimize discrepancy while maximizing representation utility. To this end, we propose a multimodal LLM-enhanced framework TPAD, which extends a distillation paradigm to decouple and align transitional patterns for promoting MSBR. TPAD establishes parallel Knowledge-MLLM and Transfer-MLLM, where the former interprets item knowledge-reflected features and the latter extracts transition-aware features underneath sessions. A transitional pattern alignment module harnessing mutual information estimation theory unites two MLLMs, alleviating distribution discrepancy and distilling transitional patterns into modal representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. | Jiajie Su, Qiyong Zhong, Yunshan Ma, Weiming Liu, Chaochao Chen, Xiaolin Zheng, Jianwei Yin, Tat-Seng Chua |
| Multi-Modal Hypergraph Enhanced LLM Learning for Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10541) | The burgeoning presence of Large Language Models (LLM) is propelling the development of personalized recommender systems. Most existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently explore the multi-view graph structure correlations inherent in recommendation scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Hypergraph Enhanced LLM Learning for multimodal Recommendation (HeLLM), designed to equip LLMs with the capability to capture intricate higher-order semantic correlations by fusing graph-level contextual signals with sequence-level behavioral patterns. In the recommender pre-training phase, we design a user hypergraph to uncover shared interest preferences among users and an item hypergraph to capture correlations within multimodal similarities among items. The hypergraph convolution and synergistic contrastive learning mechanism are introduced to enhance the distinguishability of learned representations. In the LLM fine-tuning phase, we inject the learned graph-structured embeddings directly into the LLM's architecture and integrate sequential features capturing each user's chronological behavior. This process enables hypergraphs to leverage graph-structured information as global context, enhancing the LLM's ability to perceive complex relational patterns and integrate multimodal information, while also modeling local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the advantages of fusing hypergraph-based context with sequential user behavior in LLMs for recommendation. | Xu Guo, Tong Zhang, Yuanzhi Wang, Chenxu Wang, Fuyun Wang, Xudong Wang, Xiaoya Zhang, Xin Liu, Zhen Cui |
| Integrating Textual Embeddings from Contrastive Learning with Generative Recommender for Enhanced Personalization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10545](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10545) | Recent advances in recommender systems have highlighted the complementary strengths of generative modeling and pretrained language models. We propose a hybrid framework that augments the Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit (HSTU) generative recommender with BLaIR -- a contrastive text embedding model. This integration enriches item representations with semantic signals from textual metadata while preserving HSTU's powerful sequence modeling capabilities.
  We evaluate our method on two domains from the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset, comparing it against the original HSTU and a variant that incorporates embeddings from OpenAI's state-of-the-art text-embedding-3-large model. While the OpenAI embedding model is likely trained on a substantially larger corpus with significantly more parameters, our lightweight BLaIR-enhanced approach -- pretrained on domain-specific data -- consistently achieves better performance, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive text embeddings in compute-efficient settings. | Yijun Liu |
| MSCRS: Multi-modal Semantic Graph Prompt Learning Framework for Conversational Recommender Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10921](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10921) | Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations by interacting with users through conversations. Most existing studies of CRS focus on extracting user preferences from conversational contexts. However, due to the short and sparse nature of conversational contexts, it is difficult to fully capture user preferences by conversational contexts only. We argue that multi-modal semantic information can enrich user preference expressions from diverse dimensions (e.g., a user preference for a certain movie may stem from its magnificent visual effects and compelling storyline). In this paper, we propose a multi-modal semantic graph prompt learning framework for CRS, named MSCRS. First, we extract textual and image features of items mentioned in the conversational contexts. Second, we capture higher-order semantic associations within different semantic modalities (collaborative, textual, and image) by constructing modality-specific graph structures. Finally, we propose an innovative integration of multi-modal semantic graphs with prompt learning, harnessing the power of large language models to comprehensively explore high-dimensional semantic relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves accuracy in item recommendation, as well as generates more natural and contextually relevant content in response generation. We have released the code and the expanded multi-modal CRS datasets to facilitate further exploration in related research\footnote{https://github.com/BIAOBIAO12138/MSCRS-main}. | Yibiao Wei, Jie Zou, Weikang Guo, Guoqing Wang, Xing Xu, Yang Yang |
| How Relevance Emerges: Interpreting LoRA Fine-Tuning in Reranking LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08780) | We conduct a behavioral exploration of LoRA fine-tuned LLMs for Passage Reranking to understand how relevance signals are learned and deployed by Large Language Models. By fine-tuning Mistral-7B, LLaMA3.1-8B, and Pythia-6.9B on MS MARCO under diverse LoRA configurations, we investigate how relevance modeling evolves across checkpoints, the impact of LoRA rank (1, 2, 8, 32), and the relative importance of updated MHA vs. MLP components. Our ablations reveal which layers and projections within LoRA transformations are most critical for reranking accuracy. These findings offer fresh explanations into LoRA's adaptation mechanisms, setting the stage for deeper mechanistic studies in Information Retrieval. All models used in this study have been shared. | Atharva Nijasure, Tanya Chowdhury, James Allan |
| Are Generative AI Agents Effective Personalized Financial Advisors? | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05862](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05862) | Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations. But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice. | Takehiro Takayanagi, Kiyoshi Izumi, Javier Sanz-Cruzado, Richard McCreadie, Iadh Ounis |
| PATFinger: Prompt-Adapted Transferable Fingerprinting against Unauthorized Multimodal Dataset Usage | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11509) | The multimodal datasets can be leveraged to pre-train large-scale vision-language models by providing cross-modal semantics. Current endeavors for determining the usage of datasets mainly focus on single-modal dataset ownership verification through intrusive methods and non-intrusive techniques, while cross-modal approaches remain under-explored. Intrusive methods can adapt to multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods rely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable behaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free perspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal perturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific distribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes as fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is derived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between different modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt with GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully crafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of datasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger during retrieval queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme against unauthorized multimodal dataset usage on various cross-modal retrieval architectures by 30% over state-of-the-art baselines. | Wenyi Zhang, Ju Jia, Xiaojun Jia, Yihao Huang, Xinfeng Li, Cong Wu, Lina Wang |
| Improving LLM Interpretability and Performance via Guided Embedding Refinement for Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11658) | The fast development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers growing opportunities to further improve sequential recommendation systems. Yet for some practitioners, integrating LLMs to their existing base recommendation systems raises questions about model interpretability, transparency and related safety. To partly alleviate challenges from these questions, we propose guided embedding refinement, a method that carries out a guided and interpretable usage of LLM to enhance the embeddings associated with the base recommendation system. Instead of directly using LLMs as the backbone of sequential recommendation systems, we utilize them as auxiliary tools to emulate the sales logic of recommendation and generate guided embeddings that capture domain-relevant semantic information on interpretable attributes. Benefiting from the strong generalization capabilities of the guided embedding, we construct refined embedding by using the guided embedding and reduced-dimension version of the base embedding. We then integrate the refined embedding into the recommendation module for training and inference. A range of numerical experiments demonstrate that guided embedding is adaptable to various given existing base embedding models, and generalizes well across different recommendation tasks. The numerical results show that the refined embedding not only improves recommendation performance, achieving approximately $10\%$ to $50\%$ gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Recall rate, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), but also enhances interpretability, as evidenced by case studies. | Nanshan Jia, Chenfei Yuan, Yuhang Wu, Zeyu Zheng |
| Rethinking LLM-Based Recommendations: A Query Generation-Based, Training-Free Approach | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11889](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11889) | Existing large language model LLM-based recommendation methods face several challenges, including inefficiency in handling large candidate pools, sensitivity to item order within prompts ("lost in the middle" phenomenon) poor scalability, and unrealistic evaluation due to random negative sampling. To address these issues, we propose a Query-to-Recommendation approach that leverages LLMs to generate personalized queries for retrieving relevant items from the entire candidate pool, eliminating the need for candidate pre-selection. This method can be integrated into an ID-based recommendation system without additional training, enhances recommendation performance and diversity through LLMs' world knowledge, and performs well even for less popular item groups. Experiments on three datasets show up to 57 percent improvement, with an average gain of 31 percent, demonstrating strong zero-shot performance and further gains when ensembled with existing models. | Donghee Han, Hwanjun Song, Mun Yong Yi |
| Generative Recommendation with Continuous-Token Diffusion | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007) | In recent years, there has been a significant trend toward using large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems (RecSys). Current research primarily focuses on representing complex user-item interactions within a discrete space to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, this approach faces limitations due to its discrete nature: (i) information is often compressed during discretization; (ii) the tokenization and generation for the vast number of users and items in real-world scenarios are constrained by a limited vocabulary. Embracing continuous data presents a promising alternative to enhance expressive capabilities, though this approach is still in its early stages. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, DeftRec, which incorporates \textbf{de}noising di\textbf{f}fusion models to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous \textbf{t}oken as input and target. First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with a masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and items, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous tokens. Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user preferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from pre-trained large language model. During the denoising process, we reformulate the objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive understanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation generation. Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be easily generated through score-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec surpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging LLM-based RecSys. | Haohao Qu, Wenqi Fan, Shanru Lin |
| From Conceptual Data Models to Multimodal Representation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11459](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11459) | 1) Introduction and Conceptual Framework: This document explores the concept of information design by dividing it into two major practices: defining the meaning of a corpus of textual data and its visual or multimodal representation. It draws on expertise in enriching textual corpora, particularly audiovisual ones, and transforming them into multiple narrative formats. The text highlights a crucial distinction between the semantic content of a domain and the modalities of its graphic expression, illustrating this approach with concepts rooted in structural semiotics and linguistics traditions.
  2) Modeling and Conceptual Design:  The article emphasizes the importance of semantic modeling, often achieved through conceptual networks or graphs. These tools enable the structuring of knowledge within a domain by accounting for relationships between concepts, contexts of use, and specific objectives. Stockinger also highlights the constraints and challenges involved in creating dynamic and adaptable models, integrating elements such as thesauri or interoperable ontologies to facilitate the analysis and publication of complex corpora.
  3) Applications and Multimodal Visualization:  The text concludes by examining the practical application of these models in work environments like OKAPI, developed to analyze, publish, and reuse audiovisual data. It also discusses innovative approaches such as visual storytelling and document reengineering, which involve transforming existing content into new resources tailored to various contexts. These methods emphasize interoperability, flexibility, and the intelligence of communication systems, paving the way for richer and more collaborative use of digital data.

| A Human-AI Comparative Analysis of Prompt Sensitivity in LLM-Based Relevance Judgment | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12408](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12408) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate relevance judgments for information retrieval (IR) tasks, often demonstrating agreement with human labels that approaches inter-human agreement. To assess the robustness and reliability of LLM-based relevance judgments, we systematically investigate impact of prompt sensitivity on the task. We collected prompts for relevance assessment from 15 human experts and 15 LLMs across three tasks~ -- ~binary, graded, and pairwise~ -- ~yielding 90 prompts in total. After filtering out unusable prompts from three humans and three LLMs, we employed the remaining 72 prompts with three different LLMs as judges to label document/query pairs from two TREC Deep Learning Datasets (2020 and 2021). We compare LLM-generated labels with TREC official human labels using Cohen's $\kappa$ and pairwise agreement measures. In addition to investigating the impact of prompt variations on agreement with human labels, we compare human- and LLM-generated prompts and analyze differences among different LLMs as judges. We also compare human- and LLM-generated prompts with the standard UMBRELA prompt used for relevance assessment by Bing and TREC 2024 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Track. To support future research in LLM-based evaluation, we release all data and prompts at https://github.com/Narabzad/prompt-sensitivity-relevance-judgements/. | Negar Arabzadeh, Charles L. A . Clarke |
| Benchmarking LLM-based Relevance Judgment Methods | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12558](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12558) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both academic and industry settings to automate the evaluation of information seeking systems, particularly by generating graded relevance judgments. Previous work on LLM-based relevance assessment has primarily focused on replicating graded human relevance judgments through various prompting strategies. However, there has been limited exploration of alternative assessment methods or comprehensive comparative studies. In this paper, we systematically compare multiple LLM-based relevance assessment methods, including binary relevance judgments, graded relevance assessments, pairwise preference-based methods, and two nugget-based evaluation methods~--~document-agnostic and document-dependent. In addition to a traditional comparison based on system rankings using Kendall correlations, we also examine how well LLM judgments align with human preferences, as inferred from relevance grades. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets from three TREC Deep Learning tracks 2019, 2020 and 2021 as well as the ANTIQUE dataset, which focuses on non-factoid open-domain question answering. As part of our data release, we include relevance judgments generated by both an open-source (Llama3.2b) and a commercial (gpt-4o) model. Our goal is to \textit{reproduce} various LLM-based relevance judgment methods to provide a comprehensive comparison. All code, data, and resources are publicly available in our GitHub Repository at https://github.com/Narabzad/llm-relevance-judgement-comparison. | Negar Arabzadeh, Charles L. A. Clarke |
| Validating LLM-Generated Relevance Labels for Educational Resource Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12732](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12732) | Manual relevance judgements in Information Retrieval are costly and require expertise, driving interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic assessment. While LLMs have shown promise in general web search scenarios, their effectiveness for evaluating domain-specific search results, such as educational resources, remains unexplored. To investigate different ways of including domain-specific criteria in LLM prompts for relevance judgement, we collected and released a dataset of 401 human relevance judgements from a user study involving teaching professionals performing search tasks related to lesson planning. We compared three approaches to structuring these prompts: a simple two-aspect evaluation baseline from prior work on using LLMs as relevance judges, a comprehensive 12-dimensional rubric derived from educational literature, and criteria directly informed by the study participants. Using domain-specific frameworks, LLMs achieved strong agreement with human judgements (Cohen's $\kappa$ up to 0.650), significantly outperforming the baseline approach. The participant-derived framework proved particularly robust, with GPT-3.5 achieving $\kappa$ scores of 0.639 and 0.613 for 10-dimension and 5-dimension versions respectively. System-level evaluation showed that LLM judgements reliably identified top-performing retrieval approaches (RBO scores 0.71-0.76) while maintaining reasonable discrimination between systems (RBO 0.52-0.56). These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively evaluate educational resources when prompted with domain-specific criteria, though performance varies with framework complexity and input structure. | Ratan J.

| SemCORE: A Semantic-Enhanced Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval Framework with MLLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13172](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13172) | Cross-modal retrieval (CMR) is a fundamental task in multimedia research, focused on retrieving semantically relevant targets across different modalities. While traditional CMR methods match text and image via embedding-based similarity calculations, recent advancements in pre-trained generative models have established generative retrieval as a promising alternative. This paradigm assigns each target a unique identifier and leverages a generative model to directly predict identifiers corresponding to input queries without explicit indexing. Despite its great potential, current generative CMR approaches still face semantic information insufficiency in both identifier construction and generation processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified Semantic-enhanced generative Cross-mOdal REtrieval framework (SemCORE), designed to unleash the semantic understanding capabilities in generative cross-modal retrieval task. Specifically, we first construct a Structured natural language IDentifier (SID) that effectively aligns target identifiers with generative models optimized for natural language comprehension and generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Generative Semantic Verification (GSV) strategy enabling fine-grained target discrimination. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, SemCORE is the first framework to simultaneously consider both text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks within generative cross-modal retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative cross-modal retrieval methods. Notably, SemCORE achieves substantial improvements across benchmark datasets, with an average increase of 8.65 points in Recall@1 for text-to-image retrieval. | Haoxuan Li, Yi Bin, Yunshan Ma, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua |
| InstructRAG: Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Instruction Graphs for LLM-Based Task Planning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13032) | Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their use as agents for planning complex tasks. Existing methods typically rely on a thought-action-observation (TAO) process to enhance LLM performance, but these approaches are often constrained by the LLMs' limited knowledge of complex tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers new opportunities by leveraging external databases to ground generation in retrieved information. In this paper, we identify two key challenges (enlargability and transferability) in applying RAG to task planning. We propose InstructRAG, a novel solution within a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning framework, to address these challenges. InstructRAG includes a graph to organize past instruction paths (sequences of correct actions), an RL-Agent with Reinforcement Learning to expand graph coverage for enlargability, and an ML-Agent with Meta-Learning to improve task generalization for transferability. The two agents are trained end-to-end to optimize overall planning performance. Our experiments on four widely used task planning datasets demonstrate that InstructRAG significantly enhances performance and adapts efficiently to new tasks, achieving up to a 19.2% improvement over the best existing approach. | Zheng Wang, Shu Xian Teo, Jun Jie Chew, Wei Shi |
| Taxonomy and Analysis of Sensitive User Queries in Generative AI Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08672](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08672) | Although there has been a growing interest among industries in integrating generative LLMs into their services, limited experience and scarcity of resources act as a barrier in launching and servicing large-scale LLM-based services. In this paper, we share our experiences in developing and operating generative AI models within a national-scale search engine, with a specific focus on the sensitiveness of user queries. We propose a taxonomy for sensitive search queries, outline our approaches, and present a comprehensive analysis report on sensitive queries from actual users. We believe that our experiences in launching generative AI search systems can contribute to reducing the barrier in building generative LLM-based services. | Hwiyeol Jo, Taiwoo Park, Hyunwoo Lee, Nayoung Choi, Changbong Kim, Ohjoon Kwon, Donghyeon Jeon, Eui-Hyeon Lee, Kyoungho Shin, Sun Suk Lim, Kyungmi Kim, Jihye Lee, Sun Kim |
| PATFinger: Prompt-Adapted Transferable Fingerprinting against Unauthorized Multimodal Dataset Usage | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11509) | The multimodal datasets can be leveraged to pre-train large-scale vision-language models by providing cross-modal semantics. Current endeavors for determining the usage of datasets mainly focus on single-modal dataset ownership verification through intrusive methods and non-intrusive techniques, while cross-modal approaches remain under-explored. Intrusive methods can adapt to multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods rely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable behaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free perspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal perturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific distribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes as fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is derived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between different modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt with GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully crafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of datasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger during retrieval queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme against unauthorized multimodal dataset usage on various cross-modal retrieval architectures by 30% over state-of-the-art baselines. | Wenyi Zhang, Ju Jia, Xiaojun Jia, Yihao Huang, Xinfeng Li, Cong Wu, Lina Wang |
| AgentCF++: Memory-enhanced LLM-based Agents for Popularity-aware Cross-domain Recommendations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13843](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13843) | LLM-based user agents, which simulate user interaction behavior, are emerging as a promising approach to enhancing recommender systems. In real-world scenarios, users' interactions often exhibit cross-domain characteristics and are influenced by others. However, the memory design in current methods causes user agents to introduce significant irrelevant information during decision-making in cross-domain scenarios and makes them unable to recognize the influence of other users' interactions, such as popularity factors. To tackle this issue, we propose a dual-layer memory architecture combined with a two-step fusion mechanism. This design avoids irrelevant information during decision-making while ensuring effective integration of cross-domain preferences. We also introduce the concepts of interest groups and group-shared memory to better capture the influence of popularity factors on users with similar interests. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AgentCF++.

| Improving LLM-powered Recommendations with Personalized Information | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13845](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13845) | Due to the lack of explicit reasoning modeling, existing LLM-powered recommendations fail to leverage LLMs' reasoning capabilities effectively. In this paper, we propose a pipeline called CoT-Rec, which integrates two key Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes -- user preference analysis and item perception analysis -- into LLM-powered recommendations, thereby enhancing the utilization of LLMs' reasoning abilities. CoT-Rec consists of two stages: (1) personalized information extraction, where user preferences and item perception are extracted, and (2) personalized information utilization, where this information is incorporated into the LLM-powered recommendation process. Experimental results demonstrate that CoT-Rec shows potential for improving LLM-powered recommendations. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/jhliu0807/CoT-Rec. | Jiahao Liu, Xueshuo Yan, Dongsheng Li, Guangping Zhang, Hansu Gu, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Li Shang, Ning Gu |
| Argumentative Experience: Reducing Confirmation Bias on Controversial Issues through LLM-Generated Multi-Persona Debates | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04629) | Large language models (LLMs) are enabling designers to give life to exciting new user experiences for information access. In this work, we present a system that generates LLM personas to debate a topic of interest from different perspectives. How might information seekers use and benefit from such a system? Can centering information access around diverse viewpoints help to mitigate thorny challenges like confirmation bias in which information seekers over-trust search results matching existing beliefs? How do potential biases and hallucinations in LLMs play out alongside human users who are also fallible and possibly biased?
  Our study exposes participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial issues via a mixed-methods, within-subjects study. We use eye-tracking metrics to quantitatively assess cognitive engagement alongside qualitative feedback. Compared to a baseline search system, we see more creative interactions and diverse information-seeking with our multi-persona debate system, which more effectively reduces user confirmation bias and conviction toward their initial beliefs. Overall, our study contributes to the emerging design space of LLM-based information access systems, specifically investigating the potential of simulated personas to promote greater exposure to information diversity, emulate collective intelligence, and mitigate bias in information seeking. | Li Shi, Houjiang Liu, Yian Wong, Utkarsh Mujumdar, Dan Zhang, Jacek Gwizdka, Matthew Lease |
| Adversarial Hubness in Multi-Modal Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14113](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14113) | Hubness is a phenomenon in high-dimensional vector spaces where a single point from the natural distribution is unusually close to many other points. This is a well-known problem in information retrieval that causes some items to accidentally (and incorrectly) appear relevant to many queries.
  In this paper, we investigate how attackers can exploit hubness to turn any image or audio input in a multi-modal retrieval system into an adversarial hub. Adversarial hubs can be used to inject universal adversarial content (e.g., spam) that will be retrieved in response to thousands of different queries, as well as for targeted attacks on queries related to specific, attacker-chosen concepts.
  We present a method for creating adversarial hubs and evaluate the resulting hubs on benchmark multi-modal retrieval datasets and an image-to-image retrieval system implemented by Pinecone, a popular vector database. For example, in text-caption-to-image retrieval, a single adversarial hub, generated with respect to 100 randomly selected target queries, is retrieved as the top-1 most relevant image for more than 21,000 out of 25,000 test queries (by contrast, the most common natural hub is the top-1 response to only 102 queries), demonstrating the strong generalization capabilities of adversarial hubs. We also investigate whether techniques for mitigating natural hubness are an effective defense against adversarial hubs, and show that they are not effective against hubs that target queries related to specific concepts. | Tingwei Zhang, Fnu Suya, Rishi Jha, Collin Zhang, Vitaly Shmatikov |

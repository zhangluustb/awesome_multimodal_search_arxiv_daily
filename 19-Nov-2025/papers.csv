"A Multimodal Manufacturing Safety Chatbot: Knowledge Base Design, Benchmark Development, and Evaluation of Multiple RAG Approaches",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11847,"Ensuring worker safety remains a critical challenge in modern manufacturing environments. Industry 5.0 reorients the prevailing manufacturing paradigm toward more human-centric operations. Using a design science research methodology, we identify three essential requirements for next-generation safety training systems: high accuracy, low latency, and low cost. We introduce a multimodal chatbot powered by large language models that meets these design requirements. The chatbot uses retrieval-augmented generation to ground its responses in curated regulatory and technical documentation. To evaluate our solution, we developed a domain-specific benchmark of expert-validated question and answer pairs for three representative machines: a Bridgeport manual mill, a Haas TL-1 CNC lathe, and a Universal Robots UR5e collaborative robot. We tested 24 RAG configurations using a full-factorial design and assessed them with automated evaluations of correctness, latency, and cost. Our top 2 configurations were then evaluated by ten industry experts and academic researchers. Our results show that retrieval strategy and model configuration have a significant impact on performance. The top configuration (selected for chatbot deployment) achieved an accuracy of 86.66%, an average latency of 10.04 seconds, and an average cost of $0.005 per query. Overall, our work provides three contributions: an open-source, domain-grounded safety training chatbot; a validated benchmark for evaluating AI-assisted safety instruction; and a systematic methodology for designing and assessing AI-enabled instructional and immersive safety training systems for Industry 5.0 environments.","Ryan Singh, Austin Hamilton, Amanda White, Michael Wise, Ibrahim Yousif, Arthur Carvalho, Zhe Shan, Reza Abrisham Baf, Mohammad Mayyas, Lora A.

DualGR: Generative Retrieval with Long and Short-Term Interests Modeling,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12518,"In large-scale industrial recommendation systems, retrieval must produce high-quality candidates from massive corpora under strict latency. Recently, Generative Retrieval (GR) has emerged as a viable alternative to Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR), which quantizes items into a finite token space and decodes candidates autoregressively, providing a scalable path that explicitly models target-history interactions via cross-attention. However, three challenges persist: 1) how to balance users' long-term and short-term interests , 2) noise interference when generating hierarchical semantic IDs (SIDs), 3) the absence of explicit modeling for negative feedback such as exposed items without clicks. To address these challenges, we propose DualGR, a generative retrieval framework that explicitly models dual horizons of user interests with selective activation. Specifically, DualGR utilizes Dual-Branch Long/Short-Term Router (DBR) to cover both stable preferences and transient intents by explicitly modeling users' long- and short-term behaviors. Meanwhile, Search-based SID Decoding (S2D) is presented to control context-induced noise and enhance computational efficiency by constraining candidate interactions to the current coarse (level-1) bucket during fine-grained (level-2/3) SID prediction. % also reinforcing intra-class consistency. Finally, we propose an Exposure-aware Next-Token Prediction Loss (ENTP-Loss) that treats ""exposed-but-unclicked"" items as hard negatives at level-1, enabling timely interest fade-out. On the large-scale Kuaishou short-video recommendation system, DualGR has achieved outstanding performance. Online A/B testing shows +0.527% video views and +0.432% watch time lifts, validating DualGR as a practical and effective paradigm for industrial generative retrieval.","Zhongchao Yi, Kai Feng, Xiaojian Ma, Yalong Wang, Yongqi Liu, Han Li, Zhengyang Zhou, Yang Wang"
MindRec: A Diffusion-driven Coarse-to-Fine Paradigm for Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12597,"Recent advancements in large language model-based recommendation systems often represent items as text or semantic IDs and generate recommendations in an auto-regressive manner. However, due to the left-to-right greedy decoding strategy and the unidirectional logical flow, such methods often fail to produce globally optimal recommendations. In contrast, human reasoning does not follow a rigid left-to-right sequence. Instead, it often begins with keywords or intuitive insights, which are then refined and expanded. Inspired by this fact, we propose MindRec, a diffusion-driven coarse-to-fine generative paradigm that emulates human thought processes. Built upon a diffusion language model, MindRec departs from auto-regressive generation by leveraging a masked diffusion process to reconstruct items in a flexible, non-sequential manner. Particularly, our method first generates key tokens that reflect user preferences, and then expands them into the complete item, enabling adaptive and human-like generation. To further emulate the structured nature of human decision-making, we organize items into a hierarchical category tree. This structure guides the model to first produce the coarse-grained category and then progressively refine its selection through finer-grained subcategories before generating the specific item. To mitigate the local optimum problem inherent in greedy decoding, we design a novel beam search algorithm, Diffusion Beam Search, tailored for our mind-inspired generation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MindRec yields a 9.5\% average improvement in top-1 accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to enhance recommendation performance. The implementation is available via https://github.com/Mr-Peach0301/MindRec.","Mengyao Gao, Chongming Gao, Haoyan Liu, Qingpeng Cai, Peng Jiang, Jiajia Chen, Shuai Yuan, Xiangnan He"
"Tokenize Once, Recommend Anywhere: Unified Item Tokenization for Multi-domain LLM-based Recommendation",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12922,"Large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems have achieved high-quality performance by bridging the discrepancy between the item space and the language space through item tokenization. However, existing item tokenization methods typically require training separate models for each item domain, limiting generalization. Moreover, the diverse distributions and semantics across item domains make it difficult to construct a unified tokenization that preserves domain-specific information. To address these challenges, we propose UniTok, a Unified item Tokenization framework that integrates our own mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a series of codebooks to convert items into discrete tokens, enabling scalable tokenization while preserving semantic information across multiple item domains. Specifically, items from different domains are first projected into a unified latent space through a shared encoder. They are then routed to domain-specific experts to capture the unique semantics, while a shared expert, which is always active, encodes common knowledge transferable across domains. Additionally, to mitigate semantic imbalance across domains, we present a mutual information calibration mechanism, which guides the model towards retaining similar levels of semantic information for each domain. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniTok framework is (a) highly effective: achieving up to 51.89% improvements over strong benchmarks, (b) theoretically sound: showing the analytical validity of our architectural design and optimization; and (c) highly generalizable: demonstrating robust performance across diverse domains without requiring per-domain retraining, a capability not supported by existing baselines.","Yu Hou, Won-Yong Shin"
Compact Multimodal Language Models as Robust OCR Alternatives for Noisy Textual Clinical Reports,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13523,"Digitization of medical records often relies on smartphone photographs of printed reports, producing images degraded by blur, shadows, and other noise. Conventional OCR systems, optimized for clean scans, perform poorly under such real-world conditions. This study evaluates compact multimodal language models as privacy-preserving alternatives for transcribing noisy clinical documents. Using obstetric ultrasound reports written in regionally inflected medical English common to Indian healthcare settings, we compare eight systems in terms of transcription accuracy, noise sensitivity, numeric accuracy, and computational efficiency. Compact multimodal models consistently outperform both classical and neural OCR pipelines. Despite higher computational costs, their robustness and linguistic adaptability position them as viable candidates for on-premises healthcare digitization.","Nikita Neveditsin, Pawan Lingras, Salil Patil, Swarup Patil, Vijay Mago"
MOON2.0: Dynamic Modality-balanced Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12449,"The rapid growth of e-commerce calls for multimodal models that comprehend rich visual and textual product information. Although recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for product understanding exhibit strong capability in representation learning for e-commerce, they still face three challenges: (i) the modality imbalance induced by modality mixed training; (ii) underutilization of the intrinsic alignment relationships among visual and textual information within a product; and (iii) limited handling of noise in e-commerce multimodal data. To address these, we propose MOON2.0, a dynamic modality-balanced multimodal representation learning framework for e-commerce product understanding. MOON2.0 comprises: (1) a Modality-driven Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module that adaptively processes input samples by their modality composition, enabling Multimodal Joint Learning to mitigate the modality imbalance; (2) a Dual-level Alignment method to better leverage semantic alignment properties inside individual products; and (3) an MLLM-based Image-text Co-augmentation strategy that integrates textual enrichment with visual expansion, coupled with Dynamic Sample Filtering to improve training data quality. We further introduce MBE2.0, a co-augmented multimodal representation benchmark for e-commerce representation learning and evaluation. Experiments show that MOON2.0 delivers state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MBE2.0 and multiple public datasets. Furthermore, attention-based heatmap visualization provides qualitative evidence of improved multimodal alignment of MOON2.0.","Zhanheng Nie, Chenghan Fu, Daoze Zhang, Junxian Wu, Wanxian Guan, Pengjie Wang, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng"
Large Language Models Meet Extreme Multi-label Classification: Scaling and Multi-modal Framework,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13189,"Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence across numerous domains, yet their transformative potential remains largely untapped in Extreme Multi-label Classification (XMC). Queries in XMC are associated with relevant labels from extremely large label spaces, where it is critical to strike a balance between efficiency and performance. Therefore, many recent approaches efficiently pose XMC as a maximum inner product search between embeddings learned from small encoder-only transformer architectures. In this paper, we address two important aspects in XMC: how to effectively harness larger decoder-only models, and how to exploit visual information while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate that both play a critical role in XMC separately and can be combined for improved performance. We show that a few billion-size decoder can deliver substantial improvements while keeping computational overhead manageable. Furthermore, our Vision-enhanced eXtreme Multi-label Learning framework (ViXML) efficiently integrates foundation vision models by pooling a single embedding per image. This limits computational growth while unlocking multi-modal capabilities. Remarkably, ViXML with small encoders outperforms text-only decoder in most cases, showing that an image is worth billions of parameters. Finally, we present an extension of existing text-only datasets to exploit visual metadata and make them available for future benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments across four public text-only datasets and their corresponding image enhanced versions validate our proposals' effectiveness, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by up to +8.21\% in P@1 on the largest dataset.

Examining the Usage of Generative AI Models in Student Learning Activities for Software Programming,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13271,"The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT has created new opportunities and challenges for computing education. Existing research has primarily focused on GenAI's ability to complete educational tasks and its impact on student performance, often overlooking its effects on knowledge gains. In this study, we investigate how GenAI assistance compares to conventional online resources in supporting knowledge gains across different proficiency levels. We conducted a controlled user experiment with 24 undergraduate students of two different levels of programming experience (beginner, intermediate) to examine how students interact with ChatGPT while solving programming tasks. We analyzed task performance, conceptual understanding, and interaction behaviors. Our findings reveal that generating complete solutions with GenAI significantly improves task performance, especially for beginners, but does not consistently result in knowledge gains. Importantly, usage strategies differ by experience: beginners tend to rely heavily on GenAI toward task completion often without knowledge gain in the process, while intermediates adopt more selective approaches. We find that both over-reliance and minimal use result in weaker knowledge gains overall. Based on our results, we call on students and educators to adopt GenAI as a learning rather than a problem solving tool. Our study highlights the urgent need for guidance when integrating GenAI into programming education to foster deeper understanding.","Rufeng Chen, Shuaishuai Jiang, Jiyun Shen, AJung Moon, Lili Wei"
LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12396,"Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced recommender systems by modeling interaction relationships. However, existing graph-based recommenders rely on sparse ID features and do not fully exploit textual information, resulting in low information density within representations. Furthermore, graph contrastive learning faces challenges. Random negative sampling can introduce false negative samples, while fixed temperature coefficients cannot adapt to the heterogeneity of different nodes. In addition, current efforts to enhance recommendations with large language models (LLMs) have not fully utilized their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities to guide representation learning. To address these limitations, we introduces LGHRec (LLM-CoT Enhanced Graph Neural Recommendation with Harmonized Group Policy Optimization). This framework leverages the CoT reasoning ability of LLMs to generate semantic IDs, enriching reasoning processes and improving information density and semantic quality of representations. Moreover, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm, Harmonized Group Policy Optimization (HGPO), to optimize negative sampling strategies and temperature coefficients in contrastive learning. This approach enhances long-tail recommendation performance and ensures optimization consistency across different groups. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that LGHRec improves representation quality through semantic IDs generated by LLM's CoT reasoning and effectively boosts contrastive learning with HGPO. Our method outperforms several baseline models. The code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LLM-Rec.","Hailong Luo, Bin Wu, Hongyong Jia, Qingqing Zhu, Lianlei Shan"
"Function-based Labels for Complementary Recommendation: Definition, Annotation, and LLM-as-a-Judge",https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03945,"Complementary recommendations enhance the user experience by suggesting items that are frequently purchased together while serving different functions from the query item. Inferring or evaluating whether two items have a complementary relationship requires complementary relationship labels; however, defining these labels is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity of such relationships. Complementary labels based on user historical behavior logs attempt to capture these relationships, but often produce inconsistent and unreliable results. Recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs) to infer these relationships. However, these approaches provide a binary classification without a nuanced understanding of complementary relationships. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing Function-Based Labels (FBLs), a novel definition of complementary relationships independent of user purchase logs and the opaque decision processes of LLMs. We constructed a human-annotated FBLs dataset comprising 2,759 item pairs and demonstrated that it covered possible item relationships and minimized ambiguity. We then evaluated whether some machine learning (ML) methods using annotated FBLs could accurately infer labels for unseen item pairs, and whether LLM-generated complementary labels align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that even with limited data, ML models, such as logistic regression and SVM achieve high macro-F1 scores (approximately 0.82). Furthermore, LLMs, such as gpt-4o-mini, demonstrated high consistency (0.989) and classification accuracy (0.849) under the detailed definition of FBLs, indicating their potential as effective annotators that mimic human judgment. Overall, our study presents FBLs as a clear definition of complementary relationships, enabling more accurate inferences and automated labeling of complementary recommendations.","Chihiro Yamasaki, Kai Sugahara, Yuma Nagi, Kazushi Okamoto"
TFRank: Think-Free Reasoning Enables Practical Pointwise LLM Ranking,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09539,"Reasoning-intensive ranking models built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have made notable progress. However, existing approaches often rely on large-scale LLMs and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, resulting in high computational cost and latency that limit real-world use. To address this, we propose \textbf{TFRank}, an efficient pointwise reasoning ranker based on small-scale LLMs. To improve ranking performance, TFRank effectively integrates CoT data, fine-grained score supervision, and multi-task training. Furthermore, it achieves an efficient ``\textbf{T}hink-\textbf{F}ree"" reasoning capability by employing a ``think-mode switch'' and pointwise format constraints. Specifically, this allows the model to leverage explicit reasoning during training while delivering precise relevance scores for complex queries at inference without generating any reasoning chains. Experiments show that TFRank achieves performance comparable to models with four times more parameters on the BRIGHT benchmark and demonstrates strong competitiveness on the BEIR benchmark. Further analysis shows that TFRank achieves an effective balance between performance and efficiency, providing a practical solution for integrating advanced reasoning into real-world systems.

From IDs to Semantics: A Generative Framework for Cross-Domain Recommendation with Adaptive Semantic Tokenization,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08006,"Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is crucial for improving recommendation accuracy and generalization, yet traditional methods are often hindered by the reliance on shared user/item IDs, which are unavailable in most real-world scenarios. Consequently, many efforts have focused on learning disentangled representations through multi-domain joint training to bridge the domain gaps. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches show promise, they still face critical challenges, including: (1) the \textbf{item ID tokenization dilemma}, which leads to vocabulary explosion and fails to capture high-order collaborative knowledge; and (2) \textbf{insufficient domain-specific modeling} for the complex evolution of user interests and item semantics. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{GenCDR}, a novel \textbf{Gen}erative \textbf{C}ross-\textbf{D}omain \textbf{R}ecommendation framework. GenCDR first employs a \textbf{Domain-adaptive Tokenization} module, which generates disentangled semantic IDs for items by dynamically routing between a universal encoder and domain-specific adapters. Symmetrically, a \textbf{Cross-domain Autoregressive Recommendation} module models user preferences by fusing universal and domain-specific interests. Finally, a \textbf{Domain-aware Prefix-tree} enables efficient and accurate generation. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GenCDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

DiffuGR: Generative Document Retrieval with Diffusion Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08150,"Generative retrieval (GR) re-frames document retrieval as a sequence-based document identifier (DocID) generation task, memorizing documents with model parameters and enabling end-to-end retrieval without explicit indexing. Existing GR methods are based on auto-regressive generative models, i.e., the token generation is performed from left to right. However, such auto-regressive methods suffer from: (1) mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation, e.g., an incorrect DocID token generated in early left steps would lead to totally erroneous retrieval; and (2) failure to balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy dynamically, which is crucial for practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, dubbed DiffuGR. It models DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process: during training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is learned to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR attempts to generate DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. In contrast to conventional left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR provides a novel mechanism to first generate more confident DocID tokens and refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising. Moreover, DiffuGR also offers explicit runtime control over the qualitylatency tradeoff. Extensive experiments on benchmark retrieval datasets show that DiffuGR is competitive with strong auto-regressive generative retrievers, while offering flexible speed and accuracy tradeoffs through variable denoising budgets. Overall, our results indicate that non-autoregressive diffusion models are a practical and effective alternative for generative document retrieval.","Xinpeng Zhao, Yukun Zhao, Zhenyang Li, Mengqi Zhang, Jun Feng, Ran Chen, Ying Zhou, Zhumin Chen, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhaochun Ren, Xin Xin"
MARC: Multimodal and Multi-Task Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Cold-Start Recommender System,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08181,"Recommender systems (RS) are currently being studied to mitigate limitations during cold-start conditions by leveraging modality information or introducing Agent concepts based on the exceptional reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Meanwhile, food and beverage recommender systems have traditionally used knowledge graph and ontology concepts due to the domain's unique data attributes and relationship characteristics. On this background, we propose MARC, a multimodal and multi-task cocktail recommender system based on Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizing graph database under cold-start conditions. The proposed system generates high-quality, contextually appropriate answers through two core processes: a task recognition router and a reflection process. The graph database was constructed by processing cocktail data from Kaggle, and its effectiveness was evaluated using 200 manually crafted questions. The evaluation used both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluation to demonstrate that answers generated via the graph database outperformed those from a simple vector database in terms of quality.

Don't Waste It: Guiding Generative Recommenders with Structured Human Priors via Multi-head Decoding,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10492,"Optimizing recommender systems for objectives beyond accuracy, such as diversity, novelty, and personalization, is crucial for long-term user satisfaction. To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner. Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes.","Yunkai Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Feng Lin, Ruizhong Qiu, Hanchao Yu, Jiayi Liu, Yinglong Xia, Zhuoran Yu, Zeyu Zheng, Diji Yang"
LEMUR: Large scale End-to-end MUltimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10962,"Traditional ID-based recommender systems often struggle with cold-start and generalization challenges. Multimodal recommendation systems, which leverage textual and visual data, offer a promising solution to mitigate these issues. However, existing industrial approaches typically adopt a two-stage training paradigm: first pretraining a multimodal model, then applying its frozen representations to train the recommendation model. This decoupled framework suffers from misalignment between multimodal learning and recommendation objectives, as well as an inability to adapt dynamically to new data. To address these limitations, we propose LEMUR, the first large-scale multimodal recommender system trained end-to-end from raw data. By jointly optimizing both the multimodal and recommendation components, LEMUR ensures tighter alignment with downstream objectives while enabling real-time parameter updates. Constructing multimodal sequential representations from user history often entails prohibitively high computational costs. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose a novel memory bank mechanism that incrementally accumulates historical multimodal representations throughout the training process. After one month of deployment in Douyin Search, LEMUR has led to a 0.843% reduction in query change rate decay and a 0.81% improvement in QAUC. Additionally, LEMUR has shown significant gains across key offline metrics for Douyin Advertisement. Our results validate the superiority of end-to-end multimodal recommendation in real-world industrial scenarios.","Xintian Han, Honggang Chen, Quan Lin, Jingyue Gao, Xiangyuan Ren, Lifei Zhu, Zhisheng Ye, Shikang Wu, XiongHang Xie, Xiaochu Gan, Bingzheng Wei, Peng Xu, Zhe Wang, Yuchao Zheng, Jingjian Lin, Di Wu, Junfeng Ge"
RAG-R1: Incentivizing the Search and Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs through Multi-query Parallelism,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02962,"Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, are prone to generating hallucinated or outdated content due to their static internal knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrated with Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution, these methods are fundamentally constrained by a single-query mode, leading to prohibitive latency and inherent brittleness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RAG-R1, a novel two-stage training framework centered around multi-query parallelism. Our framework enables LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process while transitioning from the single-query mode to multi-query parallelism. This architectural shift bolsters reasoning robustness while significantly reducing inference latency. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks confirm the superiority of our method, which outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.7% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.","Zhiwen Tan, Jiaming Huang, Qintong Wu, Hongxuan Zhang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu"

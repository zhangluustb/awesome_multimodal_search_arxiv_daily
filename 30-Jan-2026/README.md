| Less is More: Benchmarking LLM Based Recommendation Agents | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20316](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20316) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for personalized product recommendations, with practitioners commonly assuming that longer user purchase histories lead to better predictions. We challenge this assumption through a systematic benchmark of four state of the art LLMs GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen2.5-72B, and Gemini 2.5 Flash across context lengths ranging from 5 to 50 items using the REGEN dataset.
  Surprisingly, our experiments with 50 users in a within subject design reveal no significant quality improvement with increased context length. Quality scores remain flat across all conditions (0.17--0.23). Our findings have significant practical implications: practitioners can reduce inference costs by approximately 88\% by using context (5--10 items) instead of longer histories (50 items), without sacrificing recommendation quality. We also analyze latency patterns across providers and find model specific behaviors that inform deployment decisions. This work challenges the existing ``more context is better'' paradigm and provides actionable guidelines for cost effective LLM based recommendation systems. | Kargi Chauhan, Mahalakshmi Venkateswarlu |
| Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007) | Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that ContRec consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems. | Haohao Qu, Shanru Lin, Yujuan Ding, Yiqi Wang, Wenqi Fan |
| Field Matters: A Lightweight LLM-enhanced Method for CTR Prediction | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14057](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14057) | Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a fundamental task in modern recommender systems. In recent years, the integration of large language models (LLMs) has been shown to effectively enhance the performance of traditional CTR methods. However, existing LLM-enhanced methods often require extensive processing of detailed textual descriptions for large-scale instances or user/item entities, leading to substantial computational overhead. To address this challenge, this work introduces LLaCTR, a novel and lightweight LLM-enhanced CTR method that employs a field-level enhancement paradigm. Specifically, LLaCTR first utilizes LLMs to distill crucial and lightweight semantic knowledge from small-scale feature fields through self-supervised field-feature fine-tuning. Subsequently, it leverages this field-level semantic knowledge to enhance both feature representation and feature interactions. In our experiments, we integrate LLaCTR with six representative CTR models across four datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing LLM-enhanced methods.

| What Matters in LLM-Based Feature Extractor for Recommender? A Systematic Analysis of Prompts, Models, and Adaptation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979) | Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation. | Kainan Shi, Peilin Zhou, Ge Wang, Han Ding, Fei Wang |
| Benchmarking Multimodal Large Language Models for Missing Modality Completion in Product Catalogues | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19750](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19750) | Missing-modality information on e-commerce platforms, such as absent product images or textual descriptions, often arises from annotation errors or incomplete metadata, impairing both product presentation and downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.
  We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion. | Junchen Fu, Wenhao Deng, Kaiwen Zheng, Ioannis Arapakis, Yu Ye, Yongxin Ni, Joemon M.

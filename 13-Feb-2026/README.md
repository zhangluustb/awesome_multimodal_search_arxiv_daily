| Recurrent Preference Memory for Efficient Long-Sequence Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11605](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11605) | Generative recommendation (GenRec) models typically model user behavior via full attention, but scaling to lifelong sequences is hindered by prohibitive computational costs and noise accumulation from stochastic interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce Rec2PM, a framework that compresses long user interaction histories into compact Preference Memory tokens. Unlike traditional recurrent methods that suffer from serial training, Rec2PM employs a novel self-referential teacher-forcing strategy: it leverages a global view of the history to generate reference memories, which serve as supervision targets for parallelized recurrent updates. This allows for fully parallel training while maintaining the capability for iterative updates during inference. Additionally, by representing memory as token embeddings rather than extensive KV caches, Rec2PM achieves extreme storage efficiency. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks show that Rec2PM significantly reduces inference latency and memory footprint while achieving superior accuracy compared to full-sequence models. Analysis reveals that the Preference Memory functions as a denoising Information Bottleneck, effectively filtering interaction noise to capture robust long-term interests. | Yixiao Chen, Yuan Wang, Yue Liu, Qiyao Wang, Ke Cheng, Xin Xu, Juntong Yan, Shuojin Yang, Menghao Guo, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu, Jie Jiang |
| IntTravel: A Real-World Dataset and Generative Framework for Integrated Multi-Task Travel Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11664](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11664) | Next Point of Interest (POI) recommendation is essential for modern mobility and location-based services. To provide a smooth user experience, models must understand several components of a journey holistically: "when to depart", "how to travel", "where to go", and "what needs arise via the route". However, current research is limited by fragmented datasets that focus merely on next POI recommendation ("where to go"), neglecting the departure time, travel mode, and situational requirements along the journey. Furthermore, the limited scale of these datasets impedes accurate evaluation of performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce IntTravel, the first large-scale public dataset for integrated travel recommendation, including 4.1 billion interactions from 163 million users with 7.3 million POIs. Built upon this dataset, we introduce an end-to-end, decoder-only generative framework for multi-task recommendation. It incorporates information preservation, selection, and factorization to balance task collaboration with specialized differentiation, yielding substantial performance gains. The framework's generalizability is highlighted by its state-of-the-art performance across both IntTravel dataset and an additional non-travel benchmark. IntTravel has been successfully deployed on Amap serving hundreds of millions of users, leading to a 1.09% increase in CTR. IntTravel is available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/IntTravel. | Huimin Yan, Longfei Xu, Junjie Sun, Zheng Liu, Wei Luo, Kaikui Liu, Xiangxiang Chu |
| Uncertainty-aware Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11719](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11719) | Generative Recommendation has emerged as a transformative paradigm, reformulating recommendation as an end-to-end autoregressive sequence generation task. Despite its promise, existing preference optimization methods typically rely on binary outcome correctness, suffering from a systemic limitation we term uncertainty blindness. This issue manifests in the neglect of the model's intrinsic generation confidence, the variation in sample learning difficulty, and the lack of explicit confidence expression, directly leading to unstable training dynamics and unquantifiable decision risks. In this paper, we propose Uncertainty-aware Generative Recommendation (UGR), a unified framework that leverages uncertainty as a critical signal for adaptive optimization. UGR synergizes three mechanisms: (1) an uncertainty-weighted reward to penalize confident errors; (2) difficulty-aware optimization dynamics to prevent premature convergence; and (3) explicit confidence alignment to empower the model with confidence expression capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UGR not only yields superior recommendation performance but also fundamentally stabilizes training, preventing the performance degradation often observed in standard methods. Furthermore, the learned confidence enables reliable downstream risk-aware applications. | Chenxiao Fan, Chongming Gao, Yaxin Gong, Haoyan Liu, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He |
| SAGEO Arena: A Realistic Environment for Evaluating Search-Augmented Generative Engine Optimization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12187) | Search-Augmented Generative Engines (SAGE) have emerged as a new paradigm for information access, bridging web-scale retrieval with generative capabilities to deliver synthesized answers. This shift has fundamentally reshaped how web content gains exposure online, giving rise to Search-Augmented Generative Engine Optimization (SAGEO), the practice of optimizing web documents to improve their visibility in AI-generated responses. Despite growing interest, no evaluation environment currently supports comprehensive investigation of SAGEO. Specifically, existing benchmarks lack end-to-end visibility evaluation of optimization strategies, operating on pre-determined candidate documents that abstract away retrieval and reranking preceding generation. Moreover, existing benchmarks discard structural information (e.g., schema markup) present in real web documents, overlooking the rich signals that search systems actively leverage in practice. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce SAGEO Arena, a realistic and reproducible environment for stage-level SAGEO analysis. Our objective is to jointly target search-oriented optimization (SEO) and generation-centric optimization (GEO). To achieve this, we integrate a full generative search pipeline over a large-scale corpus of web documents with rich structural information. Our findings reveal that existing approaches remain largely impractical under realistic conditions and often degrade performance in retrieval and reranking. We also find that structural information helps mitigate these limitations, and that effective SAGEO requires tailoring optimization to each pipeline stage. Overall, our benchmark paves the way for realistic SAGEO evaluation and optimization beyond simplified settings. | Sunghwan Kim, Wooseok Jeong, Serin Kim, Sangam Lee, Dongha Lee |
| HybridRAG: A Practical LLM-based ChatBot Framework based on Pre-Generated Q&A over Raw Unstructured Documents | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11156) | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for grounding Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot responses on external knowledge. However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources. | Sungmoon Kim, Hyuna Jeon, Dahye Kim, Mingyu Kim, Dong-Kyu Chae, Jiwoong Kim |
| GPR: Towards a Generative Pre-trained One-Model Paradigm for Large-Scale Advertising Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10138](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10138) | As an intelligent infrastructure connecting users with commercial content, advertising recommendation systems play a central role in information flow and value creation within the digital economy. However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization. GPR has been fully deployed in the Tencent Weixin Channels advertising system, delivering significant improvements in key business metrics including GMV and CTCVR. | Jun Zhang, Yi Li, Yue Liu, Changping Wang, Yuan Wang, Yuling Xiong, Xun Liu, Haiyang Wu, Qian Li, Enming Zhang, Jiawei Sun, Xin Xu, Zishuai Zhang, Ruoran Liu, Suyuan Huang, Zhaoxin Zhang, Zhengkai Guo, Shuojin Yang, Meng-Hao Guo, Huan Yu, Jie Jiang, Shi-Min Hu |
| Generative Reasoning Re-ranker | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07774](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07774) | Recent studies increasingly explore Large Language Models (LLMs) as a new paradigm for recommendation systems due to their scalability and world knowledge. However, existing work has three key limitations: (1) most efforts focus on retrieval and ranking, while the reranking phase, critical for refining final recommendations, is largely overlooked; (2) LLMs are typically used in zero-shot or supervised fine-tuning settings, leaving their reasoning abilities, especially those enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) and high-quality reasoning data, underexploited; (3) items are commonly represented by non-semantic IDs, creating major scalability challenges in industrial systems with billions of identifiers. To address these gaps, we propose the Generative Reasoning Reranker (GR2), an end-to-end framework with a three-stage training pipeline tailored for reranking. First, a pretrained LLM is mid-trained on semantic IDs encoded from non-semantic IDs via a tokenizer achieving $\ge$99% uniqueness. Next, a stronger larger-scale LLM generates high-quality reasoning traces through carefully designed prompting and rejection sampling, which are used for supervised fine-tuning to impart foundational reasoning skills. Finally, we apply Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO), enabling scalable RL supervision with verifiable rewards designed specifically for reranking. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate GR2's effectiveness: it surpasses the state-of-the-art OneRec-Think by 2.4% in Recall@5 and 1.3% in NDCG@5. Ablations confirm that advanced reasoning traces yield substantial gains across metrics. We further find that RL reward design is crucial in reranking: LLMs tend to exploit reward hacking by preserving item order, motivating conditional verifiable rewards to mitigate this behavior and optimize reranking performance. | Mingfu Liang, Yufei Li, Jay Xu, Kavosh Asadi, Xi Liu, Shuo Gu, Kaushik Rangadurai, Frank Shyu, Shuaiwen Wang, Song Yang, Zhijing Li, Jiang Liu, Mengying Sun, Fei Tian, Xiaohan Wei, Chonglin Sun, Jacob Tao, Shike Mei, Hamed Firooz, Wenlin Chen, Luke Simon |
| DiffuReason: Bridging Latent Reasoning and Generative Refinement for Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09744](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09744) | Latent reasoning has emerged as a promising paradigm for sequential recommendation, enabling models to capture complex user intent through multi-step deliberation. Yet existing approaches often rely on deterministic latent chains that accumulate noise and overlook the uncertainty inherent in user intent, and they are typically trained in staged pipelines that hinder joint optimization and exploration. To address these challenges, we propose DiffuReason, a unified "Think-then-Diffuse" framework for sequential recommendation. It integrates multi-step Thinking Tokens for latent reasoning, diffusion-based refinement for denoising intermediate representations, and end-to-end Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) alignment to optimize for ranking performance. In the Think stage, the model generates Thinking Tokens that reason over user history to form an initial intent hypothesis. In the Diffuse stage, rather than treating this hypothesis as the final output, we refine it through a diffusion process that models user intent as a probabilistic distribution, providing iterative denoising against reasoning noise. Finally, GRPO-based reinforcement learning enables the reasoning and refinement modules to co-evolve throughout training, without the constraints of staged optimization. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that DiffuReason consistently improves diverse backbone architectures. Online A/B tests on a large-scale industrial platform further validate its practical effectiveness. | Jie Jiang, Yang Wu, Qian Li, Yuling Xiong, Yihang Su, Junbang Huo, Longfei Lu, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu |
| Internalizing Multi-Agent Reasoning for Accurate and Efficient LLM-based Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09829](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09829) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping recommender systems by leveraging extensive world knowledge and semantic reasoning to interpret user intent. However, effectively integrating these capabilities with collaborative signals while avoiding prohibitive inference latency remains a critical bottleneck. To address this, we propose a trajectory-driven internalization framework to develop a Single-agent Trajectory-Aligned Recommender (STAR). Specifically, to internalize complex reasoning capabilities into a single efficient model, we first design a multi-agent teacher system capable of multi-turn tool usage and reflection. This teacher utilizes a Collaborative Signal Translation mechanism to explicitly convert latent behavioral patterns into descriptive natural language evidence to enhance reasoning accuracy. Subsequently, a trajectory-driven distillation pipeline transfers this agentic logic, including planning, tool usage, and self-reflection, into the compact STAR model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAR surpasses its teacher by 8.7% to 39.5% while eliminating iterative latency, paving the way for real-time, reasoning-enhanced recommendation. | Yang Wu, Haoze Wang, Qian Li, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu, Jie Jiang |
| MLDocRAG: Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10271](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10271) | Understanding multimodal long-context documents that comprise multimodal chunks such as paragraphs, figures, and tables is challenging due to (1) cross-modal heterogeneity to localize relevant information across modalities, (2) cross-page reasoning to aggregate dispersed evidence across pages. To address these challenges, we are motivated to adopt a query-centric formulation that projects cross-modal and cross-page information into a unified query representation space, with queries acting as abstract semantic surrogates for heterogeneous multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation (MLDocRAG) framework that leverages a Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG) to organize multimodal document content around semantically rich, answerable queries. MCQG is constructed via a multimodal document expansion process that generates fine-grained queries from heterogeneous document chunks and links them to their corresponding content across modalities and pages. This graph-based structure enables selective, query-centric retrieval and structured evidence aggregation, thereby enhancing grounding and coherence in multimodal long-context question answering. Experiments on datasets MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL demonstrate that MLDocRAG consistently improves retrieval quality and answer accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for multimodal long-context understanding. | Yongyue Zhang, Yaxiong Wu |
| End-to-End Semantic ID Generation for Generative Advertisement Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10445](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10445) | Generative Recommendation (GR) has excelled by framing recommendation as next-token prediction. This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences. Existing GR approaches predominantly generate SIDs via Residual Quantization (RQ), where items are encoded into embeddings and then quantized to discrete SIDs. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline. | Jie Jiang, Xinxun Zhang, Enming Zhang, Yuling Xiong, Jun Zhang, Jingwen Wang, Huan Yu, Yuxiang Wang, Hao Wang, Xiao Yan, Jiawei Jiang |
| S-GRec: Personalized Semantic-Aware Generative Recommendation with Asymmetric Advantage | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10606](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10606) | Generative recommendation models sequence generation to produce items end-to-end, but training from behavioral logs often provides weak supervision on underlying user intent. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer rich semantic priors that could supply such supervision, direct adoption in industrial recommendation is hindered by two obstacles: semantic signals can conflict with platform business objectives, and LLM inference is prohibitively expensive at scale. This paper presents S-GRec, a semantic-aware framework that decouples an online lightweight generator from an offline LLM-based semantic judge for train-time supervision. S-GRec introduces a two-stage Personalized Semantic Judge (PSJ) that produces interpretable aspect evidence and learns user-conditional aggregation from pairwise feedback, yielding stable semantic rewards. To prevent semantic supervision from deviating from business goals, Asymmetric Advantage Policy Optimization (A2PO) anchors optimization on business rewards (e.g., eCPM) and injects semantic advantages only when they are consistent. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale production system validate both effectiveness and scalability, including statistically significant gains in CTR and a 1.19\% lift in GMV in online A/B tests, without requiring real-time LLM inference. | Jie Jiang, Hongbo Tang, Wenjie Wu, Yangru Huang, Zhenmao Li, Qian Li, Changping Wang, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu |
| Parallelism Meets Adaptiveness: Scalable Documents Understanding in Multi-Agent LLM Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17061](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17061) | Large language model (LLM) agents have shown increasing promise for collaborative task completion. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems. | Chengxuan Xia, Qianye Wu, Sixuan Tian, Yilun Hao |

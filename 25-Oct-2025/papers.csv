Automating Iconclass: LLMs and RAG for Large-Scale Classification of Religious Woodcuts,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19986,"This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire, allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92% precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy, offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.",Drew B. Thomas
Rank-GRPO: Training LLM-based Conversational Recommender Systems with Reinforcement Learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20150,"Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the recommender system paradigm by enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through conversations. Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates. Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.","Yaochen Zhu, Harald Steck, Dawen Liang, Yinhan He, Jundong Li, Nathan Kallus"
Balancing Fine-tuning and RAG: A Hybrid Strategy for Dynamic LLM Recommendation Updates,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20260,"Large Language Models (LLMs) empower recommendation systems through their advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, the dynamic nature of user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered recommender systems.","Changping Meng, Hongyi Ling, Jianling Wang, Yifan Liu, Shuzhou Zhang, Dapeng Hong, Mingyan Gao, Onkar Dalal, Ed Chi, Lichan Hong, Haokai Lu, Ningren Han"
Rotate Both Ways: Time-and-Order RoPE for Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20455,"Generative recommenders, typically transformer-based autoregressive models, predict the next item or action from a user's interaction history. Their effectiveness depends on how the model represents where an interaction event occurs in the sequence (discrete index) and when it occurred in wall-clock time. Prevailing approaches inject time via learned embeddings or relative attention biases. In this paper, we argue that RoPE-based approaches, if designed properly, can be a stronger alternative for jointly modeling temporal and sequential information in user behavior sequences. While vanilla RoPE in LLMs considers only token order, generative recommendation requires incorporating both event time and token index. To address this, we propose Time-and-Order RoPE (TO-RoPE), a family of rotary position embedding designs that treat index and time as angle sources shaping the query-key geometry directly. We present three instantiations: early fusion, split-by-dim, and split-by-head. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets and a proprietary industrial dataset show that TO-RoPE variants consistently improve accuracy over existing methods for encoding time and index. These results position rotary embeddings as a simple, principled, and deployment-friendly foundation for generative recommendation.","Xiaokai Wei, Jiajun Wu, Daiyao Yi, Reza Shirkavand, Michelle Gong"
Generative Reasoning Recommendation via LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20815,"Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large language models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as generative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic modeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals, combined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents significant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting pre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction manner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that integrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses heterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete item indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic representations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation, which builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and a curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent preference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised sequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization (SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward and Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end optimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively supports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for high-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning Recommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal transparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over strong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM recommenders.","Minjie Hong, Zetong Zhou, Zirun Guo, Ziang Zhang, Ruofan Hu, Weinan Gan, Jieming Zhu, Zhou Zhao"
RAGRank: Using PageRank to Counter Poisoning in CTI LLM Pipelines,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20768,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant architectural pattern to operationalize Large Language Model (LLM) usage in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) systems. However, this design is susceptible to poisoning attacks, and previously proposed defenses can fail for CTI contexts as cyber threat information is often completely new for emerging attacks, and sophisticated threat actors can mimic legitimate formats, terminology, and stylistic conventions. To address this issue, we propose that the robustness of modern RAG defenses can be accelerated by applying source credibility algorithms on corpora, using PageRank as an example. In our experiments, we demonstrate quantitatively that our algorithm applies a lower authority score to malicious documents while promoting trusted content, using the standardized MS MARCO dataset. We also demonstrate proof-of-concept performance of our algorithm on CTI documents and feeds.","Austin Jia, Avaneesh Ramesh, Zain Shamsi, Daniel Zhang, Alex Liu"
X-Reflect: Cross-Reflection Prompting for Multimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15172,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance the effectiveness of enriching item descriptions, thereby improving the accuracy of recommendation systems. However, most existing approaches either rely on text-only prompting or employ basic multimodal strategies that do not fully exploit the complementary information available from both textual and visual modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework, Cross-Reflection Prompting, termed X-Reflect, designed to address these limitations by prompting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly identify and reconcile supportive and conflicting information between text and images. By capturing nuanced insights from both modalities, this approach generates more comprehensive and contextually rich item representations. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing prompting baselines in downstream recommendation accuracy. Furthermore, we identify a U-shaped relationship between text-image dissimilarity and recommendation performance, suggesting the benefit of applying multimodal prompting selectively. To support efficient real-time inference, we also introduce X-Reflect-keyword, a lightweight variant that summarizes image content using keywords and replaces the base model with a smaller backbone, achieving nearly 50% reduction in input length while maintaining competitive performance. This work underscores the importance of integrating multimodal information and presents an effective solution for improving item understanding in multimodal recommendation systems.","Hanjia Lyu, Ryan Rossi, Xiang Chen, Md Mehrab Tanjim, Stefano Petrangeli, Somdeb Sarkhel, Jiebo Luo"
Efficient Multimodal Streaming Recommendation via Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05993,"Streaming recommender systems (SRSs) are widely deployed in real-world applications, where user interests shift and new items arrive over time. As a result, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as interactions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack sufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using multimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features. However, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not tailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user tastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual tones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming scenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk of forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts (XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation. XSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert networks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in response to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert and backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains model compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without overwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold start and shifting preferences in multimodal features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that XSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation quality and computational efficiency.","Yunke Qu, Liang Qu, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Hongzhi Yin"

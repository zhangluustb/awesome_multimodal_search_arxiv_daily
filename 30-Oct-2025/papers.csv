Resource-Efficient LLM Application for Structured Transformation of Unstructured Financial Contracts,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23990,"The transformation of unstructured legal contracts into standardized, machine-readable formats is essential for automating financial workflows. The Common Domain Model (CDM) provides a standardized framework for this purpose, but converting complex legal documents like Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) into CDM representations remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present an extension of the CDMizer framework, a template-driven solution that ensures syntactic correctness and adherence to the CDM schema during contract-to-CDM conversion. We apply this extended framework to a real-world task, comparing its performance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our results show that CDMizer, when integrated with a significantly smaller, open-source Large Language Model (LLM), achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency against larger, proprietary models. This work underscores the potential of resource-efficient solutions to automate legal contract transformation, offering a cost-effective and scalable approach that can meet the needs of financial institutions with constrained resources or strict data privacy requirements.","Maruf Ahmed Mridul, Oshani Seneviratne"
From Time and Place to Preference: LLM-Driven Geo-Temporal Context in Recommendations,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24430,"Most recommender systems treat timestamps as numeric or cyclical values, overlooking real-world context such as holidays, events, and seasonal patterns. We propose a scalable framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate geo-temporal embeddings from only a timestamp and coarse location, capturing holidays, seasonal trends, and local/global events. We then introduce a geo-temporal embedding informativeness test as a lightweight diagnostic, demonstrating on MovieLens, LastFM, and a production dataset that these embeddings provide predictive signal consistent with the outcomes of full model integrations. Geo-temporal embeddings are incorporated into sequential models through (1) direct feature fusion with metadata embeddings or (2) an auxiliary loss that enforces semantic and geo-temporal alignment. Our findings highlight the need for adaptive or hybrid recommendation strategies, and we release a context-enriched MovieLens dataset to support future research.","Yejin Kim, Shaghayegh Agah, Mayur Nankani, Neeraj Sharma, Feifei Peng, Maria Peifer, Sardar Hamidian, H Howie Huang"
MiniOneRec: An Open-Source Framework for Scaling Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24431,"The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has renewed interest in whether recommender systems can achieve similar scaling benefits. Conventional recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as embedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm replaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by autoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training recipe that enables competitive performance?
  We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size, validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further enhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training pipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together, these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and candidate diversity.","Xiaoyu Kong, Leheng Sheng, Junfei Tan, Yuxin Chen, Jiancan Wu, An Zhang, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He"
Iterative Critique-Refine Framework for Enhancing LLM Personalization,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24469,"Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus. Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic.","Durga Prasad Maram, Dhruvin Gandhi, Zonghai Yao, Gayathri Akkinapalli, Franck Dernoncourt, Yu Wang, Ryan A.

MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281,"Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.","Qingyao Ai, Yichen Tang, Changyue Wang, Jianming Long, Weihang Su, Yiqun Liu"

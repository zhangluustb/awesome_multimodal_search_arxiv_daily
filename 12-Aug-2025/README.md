| Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Decoding for LLM-Based Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07210](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07210) | Large language models have been widely applied to sequential recommendation tasks, yet during inference, they continue to rely on decoding strategies developed for natural language processing. This creates a mismatch between text-generation objectives and recommendation next item selection objectives. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing an Uncertainty-aware Semantic Decoding (USD) framework that combines logit-based clustering with adaptive scoring to improve next-item predictions. Our approach clusters items with similar logit vectors into semantic equivalence groups, then redistributes probability mass within these clusters and computes entropy across them to control item scoring and sampling temperature during recommendation inference. Experiments on Amazon Product datasets (six domains) gains of 18.5\% in HR@3, 11.9\% in NDCG@3, and 10.8\% in MRR@3 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Hyperparameter analysis confirms the optimal parameters among various settings, and experiments on H\&amp;M, and Netflix datasets indicate that the framework can adapt to differing recommendation domains. The experimental results confirm that integrating semantic clustering and uncertainty assessment yields more reliable and accurate recommendations. | Chenke Yin, Li Fan, Jia Wang, Dongxiao Hu, Haichao Zhang, Chong Zhang, Yang Xiang |
| Are Multimodal Embeddings Truly Beneficial for Recommendation? A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399) | Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the MMRec community. We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research. | Yu Ye, Junchen Fu, Yu Song, Kaiwen Zheng, Joemon M. Jose |
| Multi-modal Adaptive Mixture of Experts for Cold-start Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08042](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08042) | Recommendation systems have faced significant challenges in cold-start scenarios, where new items with a limited history of interaction need to be effectively recommended to users. Though multimodal data (e.g., images, text, audio, etc.) offer rich information to address this issue, existing approaches often employ simplistic integration methods such as concatenation, average pooling, or fixed weighting schemes, which fail to capture the complex relationships between modalities. Our study proposes a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework for multimodal cold-start recommendation, named MAMEX, which dynamically leverages latent representation from different modalities. MAMEX utilizes modality-specific expert networks and introduces a learnable gating mechanism that adaptively weights the contribution of each modality based on its content characteristics. This approach enables MAMEX to emphasize the most informative modalities for each item while maintaining robustness when certain modalities are less relevant or missing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MAMEX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cold-start scenarios, with superior accuracy and adaptability. For reproducibility, the code has been made available on Github https://github.com/L2R-UET/MAMEX. | Van-Khang Nguyen, Duc-Hoang Pham, Huy-Son Nguyen, Cam-Van Thi Nguyen, Hoang-Quynh Le, Duc-Trong Le |
| How Relevance Emerges: Interpreting LoRA Fine-Tuning in Reranking LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08780](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08780) | We conduct a behavioral exploration of LoRA fine-tuned LLMs for Passage Reranking to understand how relevance signals are learned and deployed by Large Language Models. By fine-tuning Mistral-7B, LLaMA3.1-8B, and Pythia-6.9B on MS MARCO under diverse LoRA configurations, we investigate how relevance modeling evolves across checkpoints, the impact of LoRA rank (1, 2, 8, 32), and the relative importance of updated MHA vs. MLP components. Our ablations reveal which layers and projections within LoRA transformations are most critical for reranking accuracy. These findings offer fresh explanations into LoRA's adaptation mechanisms, setting the stage for deeper mechanistic studies in Information Retrieval. All models used in this study have been shared. | Atharva Nijasure, Tanya Chowdhury, James Allan |
| Scaling Transformers for Discriminative Recommendation via Generative Pretraining | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03699](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03699) | Discriminative recommendation tasks, such as CTR (click-through rate) and CVR (conversion rate) prediction, play critical roles in the ranking stage of large-scale industrial recommender systems. However, training a discriminative model encounters a significant overfitting issue induced by data sparsity. Moreover, this overfitting issue worsens with larger models, causing them to underperform smaller ones. To address the overfitting issue and enhance model scalability, we propose a framework named GPSD (\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}retraining for \textbf{S}calable \textbf{D}iscriminative Recommendation), drawing inspiration from generative training, which exhibits no evident signs of overfitting. GPSD leverages the parameters learned from a pretrained generative model to initialize a discriminative model, and subsequently applies a sparse parameter freezing strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on both industrial-scale and publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of GPSD. Moreover, it delivers remarkable improvements in online A/B tests. GPSD offers two primary advantages: 1) it substantially narrows the generalization gap in model training, resulting in better test performance; and 2) it leverages the scalability of Transformers, delivering consistent performance gains as models are scaled up. Specifically, we observe consistent performance improvements as the model dense parameters scale from 13K to 0.3B, closely adhering to power laws. These findings pave the way for unifying the architectures of recommendation models and language models, enabling the direct application of techniques well-established in large language models to recommendation models.

| LLMDistill4Ads: Using Cross-Encoders to Distill from LLM Signals for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendations at eBay | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03628](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03628) | Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions. Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay. | Soumik Dey, Benjamin Braun, Naveen Ravipati, Hansi Wu, Binbin Li |
| DAGR: Decomposition Augmented Graph Retrieval with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13380](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13380) | Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To address this challenge, we introduce DAGR, a retrieval method that leverages both complex questions and their decomposition in subquestions to extract relevant, linked textual subgraphs. DAGR first breaks down complex queries, retrieves subgraphs guided by a weighted similarity function over both the original and decomposed queries, and creates a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. The resulting Graph-RAG pipeline is suited to handle complex multi-hop questions and effectively reason over graph-structured data. We evaluate DAGR on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls. | Valentin Six, Evan Dufraisse, Ga\"el de Chalendar |
| PersonalAI: A Systematic Comparison of Knowledge Graph Storage and Retrieval Approaches for Personalized LLM agents | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17001](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17001) | Personalizing language models by effectively incorporating user interaction history remains a central challenge in the development of adaptive AI systems. While large language models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graphs, automatically constructed and updated by the LLM itself, and capable of encoding information in multiple formats-including nodes, triplets, higher-order propositions, and episodic traces. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyperedges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle propagation, beam search, and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks-TriviaQA, HotpotQA, and DiaASQ-demonstrating that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning. | Mikhail Menschikov, Dmitry Evseev, Victoria Dochkina, Ruslan Kostoev, Ilia Perepechkin, Petr Anokhin, Evgeny Burnaev, Nikita Semenov |

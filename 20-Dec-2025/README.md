| From Facts to Conclusions : Integrating Deductive Reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16795](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16795) | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in external evidence, but fails when retrieved sources conflict or contain outdated or subjective information. Prior work address these issues independently but lack unified reasoning supervision. We propose a reasoning-trace-augmented RAG framework that adds structured, interpretable reasoning across three stages : (1) document-level adjudication, (2) conflict analysis, and (3) grounded synthesis, producing citation-linked answers or justified refusals. A Conflict-Aware Trust-Score (CATS) pipeline is introduced which evaluates groundedness, factual correctness, refusal accuracy, and conflict-behavior alignment using an LLM-as-a-Judge. Our 539-query reasoning dataset and evaluation pipeline establish a foundation for conflict-aware, interpretable RAG systems. Experimental results demonstrate substantial gains over baselines, most notably with Qwen, where Supervised Fine-Tuning improved End-to-End answer correctness from 0.069 to 0.883 and behavioral adherence from 0.074 to 0.722. | Shubham Mishra, Samyek Jain, Gorang Mehrishi, Shiv Tiwari, Harsh Sharma, Pratik Narang, Dhruv Kumar |
| LinkedOut: Linking World Knowledge Representation Out of Video LLM for Next-Generation Video Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16891](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16891) | Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) unlock world-knowledge-aware video understanding through pretraining on internet-scale data and have already shown promise on tasks such as movie analysis and video question answering. However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation. | Haichao Zhang, Yao Lu, Lichen Wang, Yunzhe Li, Daiwei Chen, Yunpeng Xu, Yun Fu |
| Easy Come, Easy Go? Examining the Perceptions and Learning Effects of LLM-based Chatbot in the Context of Search-as-Learning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01396](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01396) | The cognitive process of Search-as-Learning (SAL) is most effective when searching promotes active encoding of information. The rise of LLMs-based chatbots, which provide instant answers, introduces a trade-off between efficiency and depth of processing. Such answer-centric approaches accelerate information access, but they also raise concerns about shallower learning. To examine these issues in the context of SAL, we conducted a large-scale survey of educators and students to capture perceived risks and benefits of LLM-based chatbots. In addition, we adopted the encoding-storage paradigm to design a within-subjects experiment, where participants (N=92) engaged in SAL tasks using three different modalities: books, search engines, and chatbots. Our findings provide a counterintuitive insight into stakeholder concerns: while LLM-based chatbots and search engines validated perceived benefits on learning efficiency by outperforming book-based search in immediate conceptual understanding, they did not result in a long-term inferiority as feared. Our study provides insights for designing human-AI collaborative learning systems that promote cognitive engagement by balancing learning efficiency and long-term knowledge retention. | Yeonsun Yang, Ahyeon Shin, Mincheol Kang, Jiheon Kang, Xu Wang, Jean Y.

| Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning for Sentiment Analysis | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12424](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12424) | Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) identifies individuals' sentiment states in videos by integrating visual, audio, and text modalities. Despite progress in existing methods, the inherent modality heterogeneity limits the effective capture of interactive sentiment features across modalities. In this paper, by introducing a Multi-Modality Collaborative Learning (MMCL) framework, we facilitate cross-modal interactions and capture enhanced and complementary features from modality-common and modality-specific representations, respectively. Specifically, we design a parameter-free decoupling module and separate uni-modality into modality-common and modality-specific components through semantics assessment of cross-modal elements. For modality-specific representations, inspired by the act-reward mechanism in reinforcement learning, we design policy models to adaptively mine complementary sentiment features under the guidance of a joint reward. For modality-common representations, intra-modal attention is employed to highlight crucial components, playing enhanced roles among modalities. Experimental results, including superiority evaluations on four databases, effectiveness verification of each module, and assessment of complementary features, demonstrate that MMCL successfully learns collaborative features across modalities and significantly improves performance.

| Masked Diffusion for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23021) | Generative recommendation (GR) with semantic IDs (SIDs) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional recommendation approaches due to its performance gains, capitalization on semantic information provided through language model embeddings, and inference and storage efficiency. Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling. | Kulin Shah, Bhuvesh Kumar, Neil Shah, Liam Collins |

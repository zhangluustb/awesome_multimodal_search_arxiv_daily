| TRUE: A Reproducible Framework for LLM-Driven Relevance Judgment in Information Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25602](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25602) | LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However, existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent, coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across multiple dimensions. | Mouly Dewan, Jiqun Liu, Chirag Shah |
| Auto-ARGUE: LLM-Based Report Generation Evaluation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26184](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26184) | Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While open-source evaluation tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based implementation of the recent ARGUE framework for report generation evaluation. We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE outputs. | William Walden, Marc Mason, Orion Weller, Laura Dietz, Hannah Recknor, Bryan Li, Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu, Yu Hou, James Mayfield, Eugene Yang |
| MR$^2$-Bench: Going Beyond Matching to Reasoning in Multimodal Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26378) | Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial, and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks, current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example, the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and evaluation code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench. | Junjie Zhou, Ze Liu, Lei Xiong, Jin-Ge Yao, Yueze Wang, Shitao Xiao, Fenfen Lin, Miguel Hu Chen, Zhicheng Dou, Siqi Bao, Defu Lian, Yongping Xiong, Zheng Liu |
| Causal Autoencoder-like Generation of Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with an LLM Agent | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25593](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25593) | A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural. | Akash Kumar Panda, Olaoluwa Adigun, Bart Kosko |
| MHINDR -- a DSM5 based mental health diagnosis and recommendation framework using LLM | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25992](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25992) | Mental health forums offer valuable insights into psychological issues, stressors, and potential solutions. We propose MHINDR, a large language model (LLM) based framework integrated with DSM-5 criteria to analyze user-generated text, dignose mental health conditions, and generate personalized interventions and insights for mental health practitioners. Our approach emphasizes on the extraction of temporal information for accurate diagnosis and symptom progression tracking, together with psychological features to create comprehensive mental health summaries of users. The framework delivers scalable, customizable, and data-driven therapeutic recommendations, adaptable to diverse clinical contexts, patient needs, and workplace well-being programs. | Vaishali Agarwal, Sachin Thukral, Arnab Chatterjee |
| OneSearch: A Preliminary Exploration of the Unified End-to-End Generative Framework for E-commerce Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03236](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03236) | Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose \textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE) module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67% item CTR, +2.40% buyer, and +3.22% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces operational expenditure by 75.40% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from 3.26% to 27.32%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of millions of PVs daily. | Ben Chen, Xian Guo, Siyuan Wang, Zihan Liang, Yue Lv, Yufei Ma, Xinlong Xiao, Bowen Xue, Xuxin Zhang, Ying Yang, Huangyu Dai, Xing Xu, Tong Zhao, Mingcan Peng, Xiaoyang Zheng, Chao Wang, Qihang Zhao, Zhixin Zhai, Yang Zhao, Bochao Liu, Jingshan Lv, Xiao Liang, Yuqing Ding, Jing Chen, Chenyi Lei, Wenwu Ou, Han Li, Kun Gai |

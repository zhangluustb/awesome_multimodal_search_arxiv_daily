Closing the Performance Gap in Generative Recommenders with Collaborative Tokenization and Efficient Modeling,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14910,"Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec. In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight, audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the generative paradigm.","Simon Lepage, Jeremie Mary, David Picard"
Multimodal Recommendation via Self-Corrective Preference Alignmen,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14912,"With the rapid growth of live streaming platforms, personalized recommendation systems have become pivotal in improving user experience and driving platform revenue. The dynamic and multimodal nature of live streaming content (e.g., visual, audio, textual data) requires joint modeling of user behavior and multimodal features to capture evolving author characteristics. However, traditional methods relying on single-modal features or treating multimodal ones as supplementary struggle to align users' dynamic preferences with authors' multimodal attributes, limiting accuracy and interpretability. To address this, we propose MSPA (Multimodal Self-Corrective Preference Alignment), a personalized author recommendation framework with two components: (1) a Multimodal Preference Composer that uses MLLMs to generate structured preference text and embeddings from users' tipping history; and (2) a Self-Corrective Preference Alignment Recommender that aligns these preferences with authors' multimodal features to improve accuracy and interpretability. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that MSPA significantly improves accuracy, recall, and text quality, outperforming baselines in dynamic live streaming scenarios.","Yalong Guan, Xiang Chen, Mingyang Wang, Xiangyu Wu, Lihao Liu, Chao Qi, Shuang Yang, Tingting Gao, Guorui Zhou, Changjian Chen"
M-$LLM^3$REC: A Motivation-Aware User-Item Interaction Framework for Enhancing Recommendation Accuracy with LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15262,"Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals, or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions. M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.","Lining Chen, Qingwen Zeng, Huaming Chen"
MMQ: Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization Tokenization for Semantic ID Generation and User Behavioral Adaptation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15281,"Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers (ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs, derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap, where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ), a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.","Yi Xu, Moyu Zhang, Chenxuan Li, Zhihao Liao, Haibo Xing, Hao Deng, Jinxin Hu, Yu Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng, Jing Zhang"
MLLMRec: Exploring the Potential of Multimodal Large Language Models in Recommender Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15304,"Multimodal recommendation typically combines the user behavioral data with the modal features of items to reveal user's preference, presenting superior performance compared to the conventional recommendations. However, existing methods still suffer from two key problems: (1) the initialization methods of user multimodal representations are either behavior-unperceived or noise-contaminated, and (2) the KNN-based item-item graph contains noisy edges with low similarities and lacks audience co-occurrence relationships. To address such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel MLLM-driven multimodal recommendation framework with two item-item graph refinement strategies. On the one hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic descriptions using an MLLM, which are then fused with the textual metadata of items. Then, we construct a behavioral description list for each user and feed it into the MLLM to reason about the purified user preference containing interaction motivations. On the other hand, we design the threshold-controlled denoising and topology-aware enhancement strategies to refine the suboptimal item-item graph, thereby enhancing the item representation learning. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLLMRec achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 38.53% over the best baselines.","Yuzhuo Dang, Xin Zhang, Zhiqiang Pan, Yuxiao Duan, Wanyu Chen, Fei Cai, Honghui Chen"
REG4Rec: Reasoning-Enhanced Generative Model for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15308,"Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.","Haibo Xing, Hao Deng, Yucheng Mao, Jinxin Hu, Yi Xu, Hao Zhang, Jiahao Wang, Shizhun Wang, Yu Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng, Jing Zhang"
On Evaluating the Adversarial Robustness of Foundation Models for Multimodal Entity Linking,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15481,"The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking (LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by 0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset, and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of multimodal systems in adversarial environments.","Fang Wang, Yongjie Wang, Zonghao Yang, Minghao Hu, Xiaoying Bai"
Generating Negative Samples for Multi-Modal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15183,"Multi-modal recommender systems (MMRS) have gained significant attention due to their ability to leverage information from various modalities to enhance recommendation quality. However, existing negative sampling techniques often struggle to effectively utilize the multi-modal data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in negative sampling for MMRS: (1) producing cohesive negative samples contrasting with positive samples and (2) maintaining a balanced influence across different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose NegGen, a novel framework that utilizes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate balanced and contrastive negative samples. We design three different prompt templates to enable NegGen to analyze and manipulate item attributes across multiple modalities, and then generate negative samples that introduce better supervision signals and ensure modality balance. Furthermore, NegGen employs a causal learning module to disentangle the effect of intervened key features and irrelevant item attributes, enabling fine-grained learning of user preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of NegGen compared to state-of-the-art methods in both negative sampling and multi-modal recommendation.","Yanbiao Ji, Dan Luo, Chang Liu, Shaokai Wu, Jing Tong, Qicheng He, Deyi Ji, Hongtao Lu, Yue Ding"
On the Comprehensibility of Multi-structured Financial Documents using LLMs and Pre-processing Tools,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05182,"The proliferation of complex structured data in hybrid sources, such as PDF documents and web pages, presents unique challenges for current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in providing accurate answers. Despite the recent advancements of MLLMs, they still often falter when interpreting intricately structured information, such as nested tables and multi-dimensional plots, leading to hallucinations and erroneous outputs. This paper explores the capabilities of LLMs and MLLMs in understanding and answering questions from complex data structures found in PDF documents by leveraging industrial and open-source tools as part of a pre-processing pipeline. Our findings indicate that GPT-4o, a popular MLLM, achieves an accuracy of 56% on multi-structured documents when fed documents directly, and that integrating pre-processing tools raises the accuracy of LLMs to 61.3% for GPT-4o and 76% for GPT-4, and with lower overall cost.

OPDR: Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction for Semantic Embedding of Multimodal Scientific Data,https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10264,"One of the most common operations in multimodal scientific data management is searching for the $k$ most similar items (or, $k$-nearest neighbors, KNN) from the database after being provided a new item. Although recent advances of multimodal machine learning models offer a \textit{semantic} index, the so-called \textit{embedding vectors} mapped from the original multimodal data, the dimension of the resulting embedding vectors are usually on the order of hundreds or a thousand, which are impractically high for time-sensitive scientific applications.
  This work proposes to reduce the dimensionality of the output embedding vectors such that the set of top-$k$ nearest neighbors do not change in the lower-dimensional space, namely Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR). In order to develop such an OPDR method, our central hypothesis is that by analyzing the intrinsic relationship among key parameters during the dimension-reduction map, a quantitative function may be constructed to reveal the correlation between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables. To demonstrate the hypothesis, this paper first defines a formal measure function to quantify the KNN similarity for a specific vector, then extends the measure into an aggregate accuracy of the global metric spaces, and finally derives a closed-form function between the target (lower) dimensionality and other variables. We incorporate the closed-function into popular dimension-reduction methods, various distance metrics, and embedding models.","Chengyu Gong, Gefei Shen, Luanzheng Guo, Nathan Tallent, Dongfang Zhao"
Annif at SemEval-2025 Task 5: Traditional XMTC augmented by LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19675,"This paper presents the Annif system in SemEval-2025 Task 5 (LLMs4Subjects), which focussed on subject indexing using large language models (LLMs). The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the bilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach combines traditional natural language processing and machine learning techniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods for translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from monolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and second in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and fourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts.","Osma Suominen, Juho Inkinen, Mona Lehtinen"

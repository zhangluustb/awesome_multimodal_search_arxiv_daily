| Enhancing Hotel Recommendations with AI: LLM-Based Review Summarization and Query-Driven Insights | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18277](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18277) | The increasing number of data a booking platform such as Booking.com and AirBnB offers make it challenging for interested parties to browse through the available accommodations and analyze reviews in an efficient way. Efforts have been made from the booking platform providers to utilize recommender systems in an effort to enable the user to filter the results by factors such as stars, amenities, cost but most valuable insights can be provided by the unstructured text-based reviews. Going through these reviews one-by-one requires a substantial amount of time to be devoted while a respectable percentage of the reviews won't provide to the user what they are actually looking for.
  This research publication explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance short rental apartments recommendations by summarizing and mining key insights from user reviews. The web application presented in this paper, named "instaGuide", automates the procedure of isolating the text-based user reviews from a property on the Booking.com platform, synthesizing the summary of the reviews, and enabling the user to query specific aspects of the property in an effort to gain feedback on their personal questions/criteria.
  During the development of the instaGuide tool, numerous LLM models were evaluated based on accuracy, cost, and response quality. The results suggest that the LLM-powered summarization reduces significantly the amount of time the users need to devote on their search for the right short rental apartment, improving the overall decision-making procedure. | Nikolaos Belibasakis, Anastasios Giannaros, Ioanna Giannoukou, Spyros Sioutas |
| Evaluating LLM-Based Mobile App Recommendations: An Empirical Study | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18364](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18364) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to recommend mobile applications through natural language prompts, offering a flexible alternative to keyword-based app store search. Yet, the reasoning behind these recommendations remains opaque, raising questions about their consistency, explainability, and alignment with traditional App Store Optimization (ASO) metrics. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how widely-used general purpose LLMs generate, justify, and rank mobile app recommendations. Our contributions are: (i) a taxonomy of 16 generalizable ranking criteria elicited from LLM outputs; (ii) a systematic evaluation framework to analyse recommendation consistency and responsiveness to explicit ranking instructions; and (iii) a replication package to support reproducibility and future research on AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings reveal that LLMs rely on a broad yet fragmented set of ranking criteria, only partially aligned with standard ASO metrics. While top-ranked apps tend to be consistent across runs, variability increases with ranking depth and search specificity. LLMs exhibit varying sensitivity to explicit ranking instructions - ranging from substantial adaptations to near-identical outputs - highlighting their complex reasoning dynamics in conversational app discovery. Our results aim to support end-users, app developers, and recommender-systems researchers in navigating the emerging landscape of conversational app discovery. | Quim Motger, Xavier Franch, Vincenzo Gervasi, Jordi Marco |
| LLMs as Sparse Retrievers:A Framework for First-Stage Product Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18527) | Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with billions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage retrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online deployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to its interpretability and storage efficiency. However, sparse retrieval methods suffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal performance in product search scenarios. With their potential for semantic analysis, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for mitigating vocabulary mismatch issues and thereby improving retrieval quality. Directly applying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key challenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly susceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant expansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and model numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in initializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful sparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional spaces.To address these challenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs as SParsE Retrievers. PROSPER incorporates: (1)A literal residual network that alleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted literal terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical focusing window that facilitates effective training initialization via a coarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments show that PROSPER significantly outperforms sparse baselines and achieves recall performance comparable to advanced dense retrievers, while also achieving revenue increments online. | Hongru Song, Yu-an Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Sen Li, Wenjun Peng, Fuyu Lv, Xueqi Cheng |
| ImageGem: In-the-wild Generative Image Interaction Dataset for Generative Model Personalization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18433](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18433) | We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables, for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization. | Yuanhe Guo, Linxi Xie, Zhuoran Chen, Kangrui Yu, Ryan Po, Guandao Yang, Gordon Wetztein, Hongyi Wen |
| Don't Retrieve, Generate: Prompting LLMs for Synthetic Training Data in Dense Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21015](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21015) | Training effective dense retrieval models typically relies on hard negative (HN) examples mined from large document corpora using methods such as BM25 or cross-encoders (CE), which require full corpus access. We propose a corpus-free alternative: an end-to-end pipeline where a Large Language Model (LLM) first generates a query from a passage and then produces a hard negative example using only the generated query text. Our dataset comprises 7,250 arXiv abstracts spanning diverse domains including mathematics, physics, computer science, and related fields, serving as positive passages for query generation. We evaluate two fine-tuning configurations of DistilBERT for dense retrieval; one using LLM-generated hard negatives conditioned solely on the query, and another using negatives generated with both the query and its positive document as context. Compared to traditional corpus-based mining methods {LLM Query $\rightarrow$ BM25 HN and LLM Query $\rightarrow$ CE HN on multiple BEIR benchmark datasets, our all-LLM pipeline outperforms strong lexical mining baselines and achieves performance comparable to cross-encoder-based methods, demonstrating the potential of corpus-free hard negative generation for retrieval model training. | Aarush Sinha |
| Retrieval-in-the-Chain: Bootstrapping Large Language Models for Generative Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13095](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13095) | Generative retrieval (GR) is an emerging paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) to autoregressively generate document identifiers (docids) relevant to a given query. Prior works have focused on leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs to improve GR, while overlooking that their reasoning capabilities could likewise help. This raises a key question: Can explicit reasoning benefit GR? To investigate, we first conduct a preliminary study where an LLM is prompted to generate free-form chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before performing constrained docid decoding. Although this method outperforms standard GR, the generated reasoning tends to be verbose and poorly aligned with the docid space. These limitations motivate the development of a reasoning mechanism better tailored to GR.
  Therefore, we propose Reason-for-Retrieval (R4R), a reasoning-augmented framework for GR that converts free-form CoT reasoning into a compact, structured format, and iteratively refines the reasoning during the retrieval process. R4R augments an existing GR method by leveraging a reasoning-capable LLM that has been instruction-tuned for GR. At inference time, R4R first uses the LLM to generate an initial structured reasoning; then the same LLM alternates between (i) constrained decoding with the chosen GR method to produce candidate docids and (ii) updating the reasoning based on retrieval results to improve the next round. R4R does not require additional models or training, and instead a single LLM serves as both the reasoning generator and the retriever. Extensive experiments on Natural Questions, MS MARCO, and a real-world item-search benchmark validate the effectiveness of R4R. | Yingchen Zhang, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Wenjun Peng, Sen Li, Fuyu Lv |
| FinAI Data Assistant: LLM-based Financial Database Query Processing with the OpenAI Function Calling API | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14162](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14162) | We present FinAI Data Assistant, a practical approach for natural-language querying over financial databases that combines large language models (LLMs) with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted, parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1) whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs. Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high for S\&amp;P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite. We discuss design trade-offs, limitations, and avenues for deployment. | Juhyeong Kim, Yejin Kim, Youngbin Lee, Hyunwoo Byun |
| DrunkAgent: Stealthy Memory Corruption in LLM-Powered Recommender Agents | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23804) | Large language model (LLM)-powered agents are increasingly used in recommender systems (RSs) to achieve personalized behavior modeling, where the memory mechanism plays a pivotal role in enabling the agents to autonomously explore, learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, this very mechanism, serving as a contextual repository, inherently exposes an attack surface for potential adversarial manipulations. Despite its central role, the robustness of agentic RSs in the face of such threats remains largely underexplored. Previous works suffer from semantic mismatches or rely on static embeddings or pre-defined prompts, all of which are not designed for dynamic systems, especially for dynamic memory states of LLM agents. This challenge is exacerbated by the black-box nature of commercial recommenders.
  To tackle the above problems, in this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of memory-based vulnerabilities in LLM-powered recommender agents, revealing their security limitations and guiding efforts to strengthen system resilience and trustworthiness. Specifically, we propose a novel black-box attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent crafts semantically meaningful adversarial textual triggers for target item promotions and introduces a series of strategies to maximize the trigger effect by corrupting the memory updates during the interactions. The triggers and strategies are optimized on a surrogate model, enabling DrunkAgent transferable and stealthy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets across diverse agentic RSs, including collaborative filtering, retrieval augmentation and sequential recommendations, demonstrate the generalizability, transferability and stealthiness of DrunkAgent. | Shiyi Yang, Zhibo Hu, Xinshu Li, Chen Wang, Tong Yu, Xiwei Xu, Liming Zhu, Lina Yao |
| Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting with structured data like code files, another popular method, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data, particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures. | Mihir Gupte, Paolo Giusto, Ramesh S |

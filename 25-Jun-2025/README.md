| Alleviating User-Sensitive bias with Fair Generative Sequential Recommendation Model | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19777](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19777) | Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness. Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore, we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation. | Yang Liu, Feng Wu, Xuefang Zhu |
| Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794) | Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate models across three dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities. | Yuqi Zhu, Yi Zhong, Jintian Zhang, Ziheng Zhang, Shuofei Qiao, Yujie Luo, Lun Du, Da Zheng, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang |
| Answering Multimodal Exclusion Queries with Lightweight Sparse Disentangled Representations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03184](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03184) | Multimodal representations that enable cross-modal retrieval are widely used. However, these often lack interpretability making it difficult to explain the retrieved results. Solutions such as learning sparse disentangled representations are typically guided by the text tokens in the data, making the dimensionality of the resulting embeddings very high. We propose an approach that generates smaller dimensionality fixed-size embeddings that are not only disentangled but also offer better control for retrieval tasks. We demonstrate their utility using challenging exclusion queries over MSCOCO and Conceptual Captions benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach is superior to traditional dense models such as CLIP, BLIP and VISTA (gains up to 11% in AP@10), as well as sparse disentangled models like VDR (gains up to 21% in AP@10). We also present qualitative results to further underline the interpretability of disentangled representations. | Prachi J, Sumit Bhatia, Srikanta Bedathur |
| jina-embeddings-v4: Universal Embeddings for Multimodal Multilingual Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18902](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18902) | We introduce jina-embeddings-v4, a 3.8 billion parameter multimodal embedding model that unifies text and image representations through a novel architecture supporting both single-vector and multi-vector embeddings in the late interaction style. The model incorporates task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters to optimize performance across diverse retrieval scenarios, including query-document retrieval, semantic text similarity, and code search. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that jina-embeddings-v4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-modal and cross-modal retrieval tasks, with particular strength in processing visually rich content such as tables, charts, diagrams, and mixed-media formats. To facilitate evaluation of this capability, we also introduce Jina-VDR, a novel benchmark specifically designed for visually rich image retrieval. | Michael G\"unther, Saba Sturua, Mohammad Kalim Akram, Isabelle Mohr, Andrei Ungureanu, Bo Wang, Sedigheh Eslami, Scott Martens, Maximilian Werk, Nan Wang, Han Xiao |

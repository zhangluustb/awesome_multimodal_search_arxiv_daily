| LLM-Enhanced Reranking for Complementary Product Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16237](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16237) | Complementary product recommendation, which aims to suggest items that are used together to enhance customer value, is a crucial yet challenging task in e-commerce. While existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches have made significant progress in capturing complex product relationships, they often struggle with the accuracy-diversity tradeoff, particularly for long-tail items. This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets. | Zekun Xu, Yudi Zhang |
| Biases in LLM-Generated Musical Taste Profiles for Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16708](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16708) | One particularly promising use case of Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation is the automatic generation of Natural Language (NL) user taste profiles from consumption data. These profiles offer interpretable and editable alternatives to opaque collaborative filtering representations, enabling greater transparency and user control. However, it remains unclear whether users consider these profiles to be an accurate representation of their taste, which is crucial for trust and usability. Moreover, because LLMs inherit societal and data-driven biases, profile quality may systematically vary across user and item characteristics. In this paper, we study this issue in the context of music streaming, where personalization is challenged by a large and culturally diverse catalog. We conduct a user study in which participants rate NL profiles generated from their own listening histories. We analyze whether identification with the profiles is biased by user attributes (e.g., mainstreamness, taste diversity) and item features (e.g., genre, country of origin). We also compare these patterns to those observed when using the profiles in a downstream recommendation task. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of scrutable, LLM-based profiling in personalized systems. | Bruno Sguerra, Elena V. Epure, Harin Lee, Manuel Moussallam |
| Probing Ranking LLMs: A Mechanistic Analysis for Information Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18527) | Transformer networks, particularly those achieving performance comparable to GPT models, are well known for their robust feature extraction abilities. However, the nature of these extracted features and their alignment with human-engineered ones remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms of state-of-the-art, fine-tuned LLMs for passage reranking. We employ a probing-based analysis to examine neuron activations in ranking LLMs, identifying the presence of known human-engineered and semantic features. Our study spans a broad range of feature categories, including lexical signals, document structure, query-document interactions, and complex semantic representations, to uncover underlying patterns influencing ranking decisions.
  Through experiments on four different ranking LLMs, we identify statistical IR features that are prominently encoded in LLM activations, as well as others that are notably missing. Furthermore, we analyze how these models respond to out-of-distribution queries and documents, revealing distinct generalization behaviors. By dissecting the latent representations within LLM activations, we aim to improve both the interpretability and effectiveness of ranking models. Our findings offer crucial insights for developing more transparent and reliable retrieval systems, and we release all necessary scripts and code to support further exploration. | Tanya Chowdhury, Atharva Nijasure, James Allan |

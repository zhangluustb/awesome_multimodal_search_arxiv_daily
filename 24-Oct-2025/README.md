| XGen-Q: An Explainable Domain-Adaptive LLM Framework with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Software Security | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19006](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19006) | Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code understanding, but their use in cybersecurity, particularly for malware detection and analysis, remains limited. Existing detection systems often fail to generalize to obfuscated or previously unseen threats, underscoring the need for more adaptable and explainable models. To address this challenge, we introduce XGen-Q, a domain-adapted LLM built on the Qwen-Coder architecture and pretrained on a large-scale corpus of over one million malware samples, spanning both source and assembly code. XGen-Q uses a multi-stage prompt strategy combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver reliable malware identification and detailed forensic reporting, even in the presence of complex code obfuscation. To further enhance generalization, we design a training pipeline that systematically exposes the model to diverse obfuscation patterns. Experimental results show that XGen-Q achieves significantly lower perplexity than competitive baselines and exhibits strong performance on novel malware samples, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based approaches for interpretable and robust malware analysis. | Hamed Jelodar, Mohammad Meymani, Roozbeh Razavi-Far, Ali A.

| C2T-ID: Converting Semantic Codebooks to Textual Document Identifiers for Generative Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19221](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19221) | Designing document identifiers (docids) that carry rich semantic information while maintaining tractable search spaces is a important challenge in generative retrieval (GR). Popular codebook methods address this by building a hierarchical semantic tree and constraining generation to its child nodes, yet their numeric identifiers cannot leverage the large language model's pretrained natural language understanding. Conversely, using text as docid provides more semantic expressivity but inflates the decoding space, making the system brittle to early-step errors. To resolve this trade-off, we propose C2T-ID: (i) first construct semantic numerical docid via hierarchical clustering; (ii) then extract high-frequency metadata keywords and iteratively replace each numeric label with its cluster's top-K keywords; and (iii) an optional two-level semantic smoothing step further enhances the fluency of C2T-ID. Experiments on Natural Questions and Taobao's product search demonstrate that C2T-ID significantly outperforms atomic, semantic codebook, and pure-text docid baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing semantic expressiveness with search space constraints. | Yingchen Zhang, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Wenjun Peng, Sen Li, Fuyu Lv, Xueqi Cheng |
| ToolDreamer: Instilling LLM Reasoning Into Tool Retrievers | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19791](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19791) | Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence, an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e., description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of tools without inundating its context window. | Saptarshi Sengupta, Zhengyu Zhou, Jun Araki, Xingbo Wang, Bingqing Wang, Suhang Wang, Zhe Feng |
| OneSearch: A Preliminary Exploration of the Unified End-to-End Generative Framework for E-commerce Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03236](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03236) | Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose \textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE) module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67% item CTR, +2.40% buyer, and +3.22% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces operational expenditure by 75.40% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from 3.26% to 27.32%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of millions of PVs daily. | Ben Chen, Xian Guo, Siyuan Wang, Zihan Liang, Yue Lv, Yufei Ma, Xinlong Xiao, Bowen Xue, Xuxin Zhang, Ying Yang, Huangyu Dai, Xing Xu, Tong Zhao, Mingcan Peng, Xiaoyang Zheng, Chao Wang, Qihang Zhao, Zhixin Zhai, Yang Zhao, Bochao Liu, Jingshan Lv, Xiao Liang, Yuqing Ding, Jing Chen, Chenyi Lei, Wenwu Ou, Han Li, Kun Gai |
| A Generative Framework for Personalized Sticker Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17749](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17749) | Formulating information retrieval as a variant of generative modeling, specifically using autoregressive models to generate relevant identifiers for a given query, has recently attracted considerable attention. However, its application to personalized sticker retrieval remains largely unexplored and presents unique challenges: existing relevance-based generative retrieval methods typically lack personalization, leading to a mismatch between diverse user expectations and the retrieved results. To address this gap, we propose PEARL, a novel generative framework for personalized sticker retrieval, and make two key contributions: (i) To encode user-specific sticker preferences, we design a representation learning model to learn discriminative user representations. It is trained on three prediction tasks that leverage personal information and click history; and (ii) To generate stickers aligned with a user's query intent, we propose a novel intent-aware learning objective that prioritizes stickers associated with higher-ranked intents. Empirical results from both offline evaluations and online tests demonstrate that PEARL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. | Changjiang Zhou, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Yu-An Liu, Fan Zhang, Ganyuan Luo, Xueqi Cheng |
| LLMs as Sparse Retrievers:A Framework for First-Stage Product Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18527) | Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with billions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage retrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online deployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to its interpretability and storage efficiency. However, sparse retrieval methods suffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal performance in product search scenarios. With their potential for semantic analysis, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for mitigating vocabulary mismatch issues and thereby improving retrieval quality. Directly applying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key challenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly susceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant expansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and model numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in initializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful sparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional spaces.To address these challenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs as SParsE Retrievers. PROSPER incorporates: (1)A literal residual network that alleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted literal terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical focusing window that facilitates effective training initialization via a coarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments show that PROSPER significantly outperforms sparse baselines and achieves recall performance comparable to advanced dense retrievers, while also achieving revenue increments online. | Hongru Song, Yu-an Liu, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Sen Li, Wenjun Peng, Fuyu Lv, Xueqi Cheng |

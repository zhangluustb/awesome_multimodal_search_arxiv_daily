M^2VAE: Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational Autoencoder for Cold-start Item Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00452,"Cold-start item recommendation is a significant challenge in recommendation systems, particularly when new items are introduced without any historical interaction data. While existing methods leverage multi-modal content to alleviate the cold-start issue, they often neglect the inherent multi-view structure of modalities, the distinction between shared and modality-specific features. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational AutoEncoder (M^2VAE), a generative model that addresses the challenges of modeling common and unique views in attribute and multi-modal features, as well as user preferences over single-typed item features. Specifically, we generate type-specific latent variables for item IDs, categorical attributes, and image features, and use Product-of-Experts (PoE) to derive a common representation. A disentangled contrastive loss decouples the common view from unique views while preserving feature informativeness. To model user inclinations, we employ a preference-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to adaptively fuse representations. We further incorporate co-occurrence signals via contrastive learning, eliminating the need for pretraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.","Chuan He, Yongchao Liu, Qiang Li, Wenliang Zhong, Chuntao Hong, Xinwei Yao"
Session-Based Recommendation with Validated and Enriched LLM Intents,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00570,"Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item for an anonymous user in a timely manner. However, SBR suffers from data sparsity due to the short and anonymous nature of sessions. Recently, an emerging line of work has explored inferring the underlying user intents of a session using large language models (LLMs), with the generated intents serving as auxiliary training signals to enhance SBR models. Despite its promise, this approach faces three key challenges: validating intent quality, incorporating session-level multi-intents, and complementing inevitable LLM failure cases. In this paper, we propose VELI4SBR, a two-stage framework that leverages Validated and Enriched LLM-generated Intents for SBR. In the first stage, we generate high-quality intents using a predict-and-correct loop that validates the informativeness of LLM-generated intents with a global intent pool to constrain the LLM's output space and reduce hallucination. In the second stage, we enhance the SBR model using the generated intents through a lightweight multi-intent prediction and fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy that compensates for LLM failures by inferring intents from inter-session behavioral similarities. Extensive experiments show that VELI4SBR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while improving explainability.","Gyuseok Lee, Yaokun Liu, Yifan Liu, Susik Yoon, Dong Wang, SeongKu Kang"
MMRAG-DocQA: A Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation Method for Document Question-Answering with Hierarchical Index and Multi-Granularity Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00579,"The multi-modal long-context document question-answering task aims to locate and integrate multi-modal evidences (such as texts, tables, charts, images, and layouts) distributed across multiple pages, for question understanding and answer generation. The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MMRAG-DocQA, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MMRAG-DocQA method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.","Ziyu Gong, Yihua Huang, Chengcheng Mai"
Multi-modal Relational Item Representation Learning for Inferring Substitutable and Complementary Items,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22268,"We introduce a novel self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning framework designed to infer substitutable and complementary items. Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and 39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.","Junting Wang, Chenghuan Guo, Jiao Yang, Yanhui Guo, Yan Gao, Hari Sundaram"
RAG-R1 : Incentivize the Search and Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs through Multi-query Parallelism,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02962,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, while LLMs remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have aimed to enhance models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to reliance on single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, with the aim of reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.","Zhiwen Tan, Jiaming Huang, Qintong Wu, Hongxuan Zhang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu"

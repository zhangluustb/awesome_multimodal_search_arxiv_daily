Emotion-Driven Personalized Recommendation for AI-Generated Content Using Multi-Modal Sentiment and Intent Analysis,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10963,"With the rapid growth of AI-generated content (AIGC) across domains such as music, video, and literature, the demand for emotionally aware recommendation systems has become increasingly important. Traditional recommender systems primarily rely on user behavioral data such as clicks, views, or ratings, while neglecting users' real-time emotional and intentional states during content interaction. To address this limitation, this study proposes a Multi-Modal Emotion and Intent Recognition Model (MMEI) based on a BERT-based Cross-Modal Transformer with Attention-Based Fusion, integrated into a cloud-native personalized AIGC recommendation framework. The proposed system jointly processes visual (facial expression), auditory (speech tone), and textual (comments or utterances) modalities through pretrained encoders ViT, Wav2Vec2, and BERT, followed by an attention-based fusion module to learn emotion-intent representations. These embeddings are then used to drive personalized content recommendations through a contextual matching layer. Experiments conducted on benchmark emotion datasets (AIGC-INT, MELD, and CMU-MOSEI) and an AIGC interaction dataset demonstrate that the proposed MMEI model achieves a 4.3% improvement in F1-score and a 12.3% reduction in cross-entropy loss compared to the best fusion-based transformer baseline. Furthermore, user-level online evaluations reveal that emotion-driven recommendations increase engagement time by 15.2% and enhance satisfaction scores by 11.8%, confirming the model's effectiveness in aligning AI-generated content with users' affective and intentional states. This work highlights the potential of cross-modal emotional intelligence for next-generation AIGC ecosystems, enabling adaptive, empathetic, and context-aware recommendation experiences.","Zheqi Hu, Xuanjing Chen, Jinlin Hu"
FAIR: Focused Attention Is All You Need for Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11254,"Recently, transformer-based generative recommendation has garnered significant attention for user behavior modeling. However, it often requires discretizing items into multi-code representations (e.g., typically four code tokens or more), which sharply increases the length of the original item sequence. This expansion poses challenges to transformer-based models for modeling user behavior sequences with inherent noises, since they tend to overallocate attention to irrelevant or noisy context. To mitigate this issue, we propose FAIR, the first generative recommendation framework with focused attention, which enhances attention scores to relevant context while suppressing those to irrelevant ones. Specifically, we propose (1) a focused attention mechanism integrated into the standard Transformer, which learns two separate sets of Q and K attention weights and computes their difference as the final attention scores to eliminate attention noise while focusing on relevant contexts; (2) a noise-robustness objective, which encourages the model to maintain stable attention patterns under stochastic perturbations, preventing undesirable shifts toward irrelevant context due to noise; and (3) a mutual information maximization objective, which guides the model to identify contexts that are most informative for next-item prediction. We validate the effectiveness of FAIR on four public benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.","Longtao Xiao, Haolin Zhang, Guohao Cai, Jieming Zhu, Yifan Wang, Heng Chang, Zhenhua Dong, Xiu Li, Ruixuan Li"
VLM2GeoVec: Toward Universal Multimodal Embeddings for Remote Sensing,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11490,"Satellite imagery differs fundamentally from natural images: its aerial viewpoint, very high resolution, diverse scale variations, and abundance of small objects demand both region-level spatial reasoning and holistic scene understanding. Current remote-sensing approaches remain fragmented between dual-encoder retrieval models, which excel at large-scale cross-modal search but cannot interleave modalities, and generative assistants, which support region-level interpretation but lack scalable retrieval capabilities. We propose $\textbf{VLM2GeoVec}$, an instruction-following, single-encoder vision-language model trained contrastively to embed interleaved inputs (images, text, bounding boxes, and geographic coordinates) in a unified vector space. Our single encoder interleaves all inputs into one joint embedding trained with a contrastive loss, eliminating multi-stage pipelines and task-specific modules. To evaluate its versatility, we introduce $\textbf{RSMEB}$, a novel benchmark covering key remote-sensing embedding applications: scene classification; cross-modal search; compositional retrieval; visual-question answering; visual grounding and region-level reasoning; and semantic geospatial retrieval. On RSMEB, it achieves $\textbf{26.6%}$ P@1 on region-caption retrieval (+25 pp vs. dual-encoder baselines), $\textbf{32.5%}$ P@1 on referring-expression retrieval (+19 pp), and $\textbf{17.8%}$ P@1 on semantic geo-localization retrieval (over $3\times$ prior best), while matching or exceeding specialized baselines on conventional tasks such as scene classification and cross-modal retrieval. VLM2GeoVec unifies scalable retrieval with region-level spatial reasoning, enabling cohesive multimodal analysis in remote sensing. We will publicly release the code, checkpoints, and data upon acceptance.","Emanuel S\'anchez Aimar, Gulnaz Zhambulova, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Yonghao Xu, Michael Felsberg"
MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281,"Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.","Qingyao Ai, Yichen Tang, Changyue Wang, Jianming Long, Weihang Su, Yiqun Liu"

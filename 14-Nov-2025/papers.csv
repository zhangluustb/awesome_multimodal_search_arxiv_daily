NeuroCLIP: Brain-Inspired Prompt Tuning for EEG-to-Image Multimodal Contrastive Learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09250,"Recent advances in brain-inspired artificial intelligence have sought to align neural signals with visual semantics using multimodal models such as CLIP. However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality-level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.","Jiyuan Wang, Li Zhang, Haipeng Lin, Qile Liu, Gan Huang, Ziyu Li, Zhen Liang, Xia Wu"
M^2VAE: Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational Autoencoder for Cold-start Item Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00452,"Cold-start item recommendation is a significant challenge in recommendation systems, particularly when new items are introduced without any historical interaction data. While existing methods leverage multi-modal content to alleviate the cold-start issue, they often neglect the inherent multi-view structure of modalities, the distinction between shared and modality-specific features. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Multi-View Variational AutoEncoder (M^2VAE), a generative model that addresses the challenges of modeling common and unique views in attribute and multi-modal features, as well as user preferences over single-typed item features. Specifically, we generate type-specific latent variables for item IDs, categorical attributes, and image features, and use Product-of-Experts (PoE) to derive a common representation. A disentangled contrastive loss decouples the common view from unique views while preserving feature informativeness. To model user inclinations, we employ a preference-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to adaptively fuse representations. We further incorporate co-occurrence signals via contrastive learning, eliminating the need for pretraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.","Chuan He, Yongchao Liu, Qiang Li, Wenliang Zhong, Chuntao Hong, Xinwei Yao"
ReFineG: Synergizing Small Supervised Models and LLMs for Low-Resource Grounded Multimodal NER,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10975,"Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) extends traditional NER by jointly detecting textual mentions and grounding them to visual regions. While existing supervised methods achieve strong performance, they rely on costly multimodal annotations and often underperform in low-resource domains. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong generalization but suffer from Domain Knowledge Conflict, producing redundant or incorrect mentions for domain-specific entities. To address these challenges, we propose ReFineG, a three-stage collaborative framework that integrates small supervised models with frozen MLLMs for low-resource GMNER. In the Training Stage, a domain-aware NER data synthesis strategy transfers LLM knowledge to small models with supervised training while avoiding domain knowledge conflicts. In the Refinement Stage, an uncertainty-based mechanism retains confident predictions from supervised models and delegates uncertain ones to the MLLM. In the Grounding Stage, a multimodal context selection algorithm enhances visual grounding through analogical reasoning. In the CCKS2025 GMNER Shared Task, ReFineG ranked second with an F1 score of 0.6461 on the online leaderboard, demonstrating its effectiveness with limited annotations.","Jielong Tang, Shuang Wang, Zhenxing Wang, Jianxing Yu, Jian Yin"
Multimodal Adversarial Defense for Vision-Language Models by Leveraging One-To-Many Relationships,https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18770,"Pre-trained vision-language (VL) models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, existing defense methods primarily focus on image classification, overlooking two key aspects of VL tasks: multimodal attacks, where both image and text can be perturbed, and the one-to-many relationship of images and texts, where a single image can correspond to multiple textual descriptions and vice versa (1:N and N:1). This work is the first to explore defense strategies against multimodal attacks in VL tasks, whereas prior VL defense methods focus on vision robustness. We propose multimodal adversarial training (MAT), which incorporates adversarial perturbations in both image and text modalities during training, significantly outperforming existing unimodal defenses. Furthermore, we discover that MAT is limited by deterministic one-to-one (1:1) image-text pairs in VL training data. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive study on leveraging one-to-many relationships to enhance robustness, investigating diverse augmentation techniques. Our analysis shows that, for a more effective defense, augmented image-text pairs should be well-aligned, diverse, yet avoid distribution shift -- conditions overlooked by prior research. This work pioneers defense strategies against multimodal attacks, providing insights for building robust VLMs from both optimization and data perspectives.","Futa Waseda, Antonio Tejero-de-Pablos, Isao Echizen"

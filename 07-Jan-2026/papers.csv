The Discovery Gap: How Product Hunt Startups Vanish in LLM Organic Discovery Queries,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00912,"When someone asks ChatGPT to recommend a project management tool, which products show up in the response? And more importantly for startup founders: will their newly launched product ever appear? This research set out to answer these questions.
  I randomly selected 112 startups from the top 500 products featured on the 2025 Product Hunt leaderboard and tested each one across 2,240 queries to two different large language models: ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Perplexity (sonar with web search).
  The results were striking. When users asked about products by name, both LLMs recognized them almost perfectly: 99.4% for ChatGPT and 94.3% for Perplexity. But when users asked discovery-style questions like ""What are the best AI tools launched this year?"" the success rates collapsed to 3.32% and 8.29% respectively. That's a gap of 30-to-1 for ChatGPT.
  Perhaps the most surprising finding was that Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), the practice of optimizing website content for AI visibility, showed no correlation with actual discovery rates. Products with high GEO scores were no more likely to appear in organic queries than products with low scores.
  What did matter? For Perplexity, traditional SEO signals like referring domains (r = +0.319, p < 0.001) and Product Hunt ranking (r = -0.286, p = 0.002) predicted visibility. After cleaning the Reddit data for false positives, community presence also emerged as significant (r = +0.395, p = 0.002).
  The practical takeaway is counterintuitive: don't optimize for AI discovery directly. Instead, build the SEO foundation first and LLM visibility will follow.",Amit Prakash Sharma
MACA: A Framework for Distilling Trustworthy LLMs into Efficient Retrievers,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00926,"Modern enterprise retrieval systems must handle short, underspecified queries such as ``foreign transaction fee refund'' and ``recent check status''. In these cases, semantic nuance and metadata matter but per-query large language model (LLM) re-ranking and manual labeling are costly. We present Metadata-Aware Cross-Model Alignment (MACA), which distills a calibrated metadata aware LLM re-ranker into a compact student retriever, avoiding online LLM calls. A metadata-aware prompt verifies the teacher's trustworthiness by checking consistency under permutations and robustness to paraphrases, then supplies listwise scores, hard negatives, and calibrated relevance margins. The student trains with MACA's MetaFusion objective, which combines a metadata conditioned ranking loss with a cross model margin loss so it learns to push the correct answer above semantically similar candidates with mismatched topic, sub-topic, or entity. On a proprietary consumer banking FAQ corpus and BankFAQs, the MACA teacher surpasses a MAFA baseline at Accuracy@1 by five points on the proprietary set and three points on BankFAQs. MACA students substantially outperform pretrained encoders; e.g., on the proprietary corpus MiniLM Accuracy@1 improves from 0.23 to 0.48, while keeping inference free of LLM calls and supporting retrieval-augmented generation.","Satya Swaroop Gudipudi, Sahil Girhepuje, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru, Kristine Ma"
AlignUSER: Human-Aligned LLM Agents via World Models for Recommender System Evaluation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00930,"Evaluating recommender systems remains challenging due to the gap between offline metrics and real user behavior, as well as the scarcity of interaction data. Recent work explores large language model (LLM) agents as synthetic users, yet they typically rely on few-shot prompting, which yields a shallow understanding of the environment and limits their ability to faithfully reproduce user actions. We introduce AlignUSER, a framework that learns world-model-driven agents from human interactions. Given rollout sequences of actions and states, we formalize world modeling as a next state prediction task that helps the agent internalize the environment. To align actions with human personas, we generate counterfactual trajectories around demonstrations and prompt the LLM to compare its decisions with human choices, identify suboptimal actions, and extract lessons. The learned policy is then used to drive agent interactions with the recommender system. We evaluate AlignUSER across multiple datasets and demonstrate closer alignment with genuine humans than prior work, both at the micro and macro levels.","Nicolas Bougie, Gian Maria Marconi, Tony Yip, Narimasa Watanabe"
ScienceDB AI: An LLM-Driven Agentic Recommender System for Large-Scale Scientific Data Sharing Services,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01118,"The rapid growth of AI for Science (AI4S) has underscored the significance of scientific datasets, leading to the establishment of numerous national scientific data centers and sharing platforms. Despite this progress, efficiently promoting dataset sharing and utilization for scientific research remains challenging. Scientific datasets contain intricate domain-specific knowledge and contexts, rendering traditional collaborative filtering-based recommenders inadequate. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to build conversational agents capable of deep semantic understanding and personalized recommendations. In response, we present ScienceDB AI, a novel LLM-driven agentic recommender system developed on Science Data Bank (ScienceDB), one of the largest global scientific data-sharing platforms. ScienceDB AI leverages natural language conversations and deep reasoning to accurately recommend datasets aligned with researchers' scientific intents and evolving requirements. The system introduces several innovations: a Scientific Intention Perceptor to extract structured experimental elements from complicated queries, a Structured Memory Compressor to manage multi-turn dialogues effectively, and a Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Trustworthy RAG) framework. The Trustworthy RAG employs a two-stage retrieval mechanism and provides citable dataset references via Citable Scientific Task Record (CSTR) identifiers, enhancing recommendation trustworthiness and reproducibility. Through extensive offline and online experiments using over 10 million real-world datasets, ScienceDB AI has demonstrated significant effectiveness. To our knowledge, ScienceDB AI is the first LLM-driven conversational recommender tailored explicitly for large-scale scientific dataset sharing services. The platform is publicly accessible at: https://ai.scidb.cn/en.","Qingqing Long, Haotian Chen, Chenyang Zhao, Xiaolei Du, Xuezhi Wang, Pengyao Wang, Chengzan Li, Yuanchun Zhou, Hengshu Zhu"
OpenNovelty: An LLM-powered Agentic System for Verifiable Scholarly Novelty Assessment,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01576,"Evaluating novelty is critical yet challenging in peer review, as reviewers must assess submissions against a vast, rapidly evolving literature. This report presents OpenNovelty, an LLM-powered agentic system for transparent, evidence-based novelty analysis. The system operates through four phases: (1) extracting the core task and contribution claims to generate retrieval queries; (2) retrieving relevant prior work based on extracted queries via semantic search engine; (3) constructing a hierarchical taxonomy of core-task-related work and performing contribution-level full-text comparisons against each contribution; and (4) synthesizing all analyses into a structured novelty report with explicit citations and evidence snippets. Unlike naive LLM-based approaches, \textsc{OpenNovelty} grounds all assessments in retrieved real papers, ensuring verifiable judgments. We deploy our system on 500+ ICLR 2026 submissions with all reports publicly available on our website, and preliminary analysis suggests it can identify relevant prior work, including closely related papers that authors may overlook. OpenNovelty aims to empower the research community with a scalable tool that promotes fair, consistent, and evidence-backed peer review.","Ming Zhang, Kexin Tan, Yueyuan Huang, Yujiong Shen, Chunchun Ma, Li Ju, Xinran Zhang, Yuhui Wang, Wenqing Jing, Jingyi Deng, Huayu Sha, Binze Hu, Jingqi Tong, Changhao Jiang, Yage Geng, Yuankai Ying, Yue Zhang, Zhangyue Yin, Zhiheng Xi, Shihan Dou, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang"
When Attention Becomes Exposure in Generative Search,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01750,"Generative search engines are reshaping information access by replacing traditional ranked lists with synthesized answers and references. In parallel, with the growth of Web3 platforms, incentive-driven creator ecosystems have become an essential part of how enterprises build visibility and community by rewarding creators for contributing to shared narratives. However, the extent to which exposure in generative search engine citations is shaped by external attention markets remains uncertain. In this study, we audit the exposure for 44 Web3 enterprises. First, we show that the creator community around each enterprise is persistent over time. Second, enterprise-specific queries reveal that more popular voices systematically receive greater citation exposure than others. Third, we find that larger follower bases and enterprises with more concentrated creator cores are associated with higher-ranked exposure. Together, these results show that generative search engine citations exhibit exposure bias toward already prominent voices, which risks entrenching incumbents and narrowing viewpoint diversity.","Shayan Alipour, Mehdi Kargar, Morteza Zihayat"
Query-Document Dense Vectors for LLM Relevance Judgment Bias Analysis,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01751,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used as relevance assessors for Information Retrieval (IR) evaluation collection creation due to reduced cost and increased scalability as compared to human assessors. While previous research has looked at the reliability of LLMs as compared to human assessors, in this work, we aim to understand if LLMs make systematic mistakes when judging relevance, rather than just understanding how good they are on average. To this aim, we propose a novel representational method for queries and documents that allows us to analyze relevance label distributions and compare LLM and human labels to identify patterns of disagreement and localize systematic areas of disagreement. We introduce a clustering-based framework that embeds query-document (Q-D) pairs into a joint semantic space, treating relevance as a relational property. Experiments on TREC Deep Learning 2019 and 2020 show that systematic disagreement between humans and LLMs is concentrated in specific semantic clusters rather than distributed randomly. Query-level analyses reveal recurring failures, most often in definition-seeking, policy-related, or ambiguous contexts. Queries with large variation in agreement across their clusters emerge as disagreement hotspots, where LLMs tend to under-recall relevant content or over-include irrelevant material. This framework links global diagnostics with localized clustering to uncover hidden weaknesses in LLM judgments, enabling bias-aware and more reliable IR evaluation.","Samaneh Mohtadi, Gianluca Demartini"
CogCanvas: Compression-Resistant Cognitive Artifacts for Long LLM Conversations,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00821,"Large language models face a fundamental tension between context window limits and information fidelity in long conversations. Existing approaches--truncation and summarization--either discard early information or lose nuanced details. We introduce CogCanvas, a training-free framework that extracts verbatim-grounded cognitive artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) from conversation turns and organizes them into a temporal-aware graph for compression-resistant retrieval.
  On the LoCoMo benchmark, CogCanvas achieves 34.7% overall accuracy, outperforming RAG (25.6%, +9.1pp) and GraphRAG (13.7%, +21.0pp). The advantage is most pronounced on temporal reasoning: 31.5% vs. 9.3% (RAG) and 5.0% (GraphRAG)--a +530% relative improvement. On multi-hop causal reasoning, CogCanvas achieves 81.0% pass rate vs. 40.0% for GraphRAG (+41.0pp). Controlled benchmarks show 97.5% recall (+78.5pp vs. summarization) with 93.0% exact match preservation.
  While heavily-optimized approaches achieve higher absolute scores through dedicated training (EverMemOS: approximately 92%), our training-free approach provides practitioners with an immediately-deployable alternative that significantly outperforms standard baselines.

SoulSeek: Exploring the Use of Social Cues in LLM-based Information Seeking,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01094,"Social cues, which convey others' presence, behaviors, or identities, play a crucial role in human information seeking by helping individuals judge relevance and trustworthiness. However, existing LLM-based search systems primarily rely on semantic features, creating a misalignment with the socialized cognition underlying natural information seeking. To address this gap, we explore how the integration of social cues into LLM-based search influences users' perceptions, experiences, and behaviors. Focusing on social media platforms that are beginning to adopt LLM-based search, we integrate design workshops, the implementation of the prototype system (SoulSeek), a between-subjects study, and mixed-method analyses to examine both outcome- and process-level findings. The workshop informs the prototype's cue-integrated design. The study shows that social cues improve perceived outcomes and experiences, promote reflective information behaviors, and reveal limits of current LLM-based search. We propose design implications emphasizing better social-knowledge understanding, personalized cue settings, and controllable interactions.","Yubo Shu, Peng Zhang, Meng Wu, Yan Chen, Haoxuan Zhou, Guanming Liu, Yu Zhang, Liuxin Zhang, Qianying Wang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu"
Judging with Personality and Confidence: A Study on Personality-Conditioned LLM Relevance Assessment,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01862,"Recent studies have shown that prompting can enable large language models (LLMs) to simulate specific personality traits and produce behaviors that align with those traits. However, there is limited understanding of how these simulated personalities influence critical web search decisions, specifically relevance assessment. Moreover, few studies have examined how simulated personalities impact confidence calibration, specifically the tendencies toward overconfidence or underconfidence. This gap exists even though psychological literature suggests these biases are trait-specific, often linking high extraversion to overconfidence and high neuroticism to underconfidence. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study evaluating multiple LLMs, including commercial models and open-source models, prompted to simulate Big Five personality traits. We tested these models across three test collections (TREC DL 2019, TREC DL 2020, and LLMJudge), collecting two key outputs for each query-document pair: a relevance judgment and a self-reported confidence score.
  The findings show that personalities such as low agreeableness consistently align more closely with human labels than the unprompted condition. Additionally, low conscientiousness performs well in balancing the suppression of both overconfidence and underconfidence. We also observe that relevance scores and confidence distributions vary systematically across different personalities. Based on the above findings, we incorporate personality-conditioned scores and confidence as features in a random forest classifier. This approach achieves performance that surpasses the best single-personality condition on a new dataset (TREC DL 2021), even with limited training data. These findings highlight that personality-derived confidence offers a complementary predictive signal, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLM evaluators.","Nuo Chen, Hanpei Fang, Piaohong Wang, Jiqun Liu, Tetsuya Sakai, Xiao-Ming Wu"
A Multi-Task Embedder For Retrieval Augmented LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07554,"LLMs confront inherent limitations in terms of its knowledge, memory, and action. The retrieval augmentation stands as a vital mechanism to address these limitations, which brings in useful information from external sources to augment the LLM. However, existing retrieval methods encounter two pressing issues. On one hand, the general retrievers are not properly optimized for retrieval augmentation hence exhibit limited effectiveness; on the other hand, the task-specific retrievers excel in the targeted retrieval augmentation scenario, while lack the versatility to handle diverse scenarios. In this work, we propose \textbf{LLM-Embedder} for the unified support of diverse retrieval augmentation scenarios. Our method presents three technical contributions. Firstly, we introduce a new \textit{reward formulation}, namely {rank-aware reward}. It exploits the ranking position of the desired output among $N$ sampled outputs from the LLM, which leads to fine-grained and robust computation of reward from the LLM's feedback. Secondly, we design a novel \textit{distillation objective}, called graded distillation. It incorporates both the absolute value and the relative order of the reward for more sufficient utilization of the LLM's feedback. Thirdly, we systematically optimize the \textit{multi-task learning}, which effectively unifies the multiple retrieval functionalities into one model. In our experiment, LLM-Embedder notably improves the LLM's performances in various downstream tasks, and outperforms both general and task-specific retrievers with a substantial advantage.","Peitian Zhang, Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Zhicheng Dou, Jian-Yun Nie"
Adaptive Evidence Budgeting for Scalable Long-Document Reranking with LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06254,"Decoder-only LLM rerankers are powerful but often struggle with long documents: inference is costly and relevance signals can be diluted as irrelevant text accumulates in the context window. Motivated by an attention analysis showing that relevance-aligned heads degrade when non-relevant text is appended, we propose EviRerank, a scalable framework that (i) scores document blocks with a lightweight selector (BM25, bi-encoder, or cross-encoder), (ii) constructs a compact evidence context under a strict token budget, and (iii) reranks with a decoder-only LLM. Our key contribution is Adaptive Evidence Budgeting (AEB), an information-density-aware dynamic stopping strategy that avoids low-utility tail blocks, and we further study Summary Augmentation (SA) within the same budget. Across TREC DL'19, DL'23, and MLDR-zh, EviRerank consistently improves over full-document LLM reranking and strong block-selection baselines while substantially reducing the required input length. On TREC DL'19, EviRerank achieves 0.743 nDCG@10 and 0.307 MAP, improving over RankLLaMA (0.701/0.288) by +0.042 nDCG@10 (+6.0%) and +0.019 MAP (+6.6%).","Minghan Li, Eric Gaussier, Juntao Li, Guodong Zhou"
Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665,"Large language models (LLMs) based recommender systems (RecSys) can adapt to different domains flexibly. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, encompassing implicit feedback such as clicked items and explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed by novel privacy attacks. However, no study has been conducted on this important issue. We design several membership inference attacks (MIAs) aimed to revealing whether system prompts include victims' historical interactions. The attacks are \emph{Similarity, Memorization, Inquiry, and Poisoning attacks}, each utilizing unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on five of the latest open-source LLMs and three well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat to LLM RecSys is realistic: inquiry and poisoning attacks show significantly high attack advantages. We also discussed possible methods to mitigate such MIA threats. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts, the position of the victim in the shots, the number of poisoning items in the prompt,etc.","Jiajie He, Min-Chun Chen, Xintong Chen, Xinyang Fang, Yuechun Gu, Keke Chen"

| Fine Grained Evaluation of LLMs-as-Judges | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08919](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08919) | A good deal of recent research has focused on how Large Language Models
  (LLMs) may be used as `judges' in place of humans to evaluate the quality
  of the output produced by various text / image processing systems. Within
  this broader context, a number of studies have investigated the specific
  question of how effectively LLMs can be used as relevance assessors for
  the standard ad hoc task in Information Retrieval (IR). We extend these
  studies by looking at additional questions. Most importantly, we use a
  Wikipedia based test collection created by the INEX initiative, and
  prompt LLMs to not only judge whether documents are relevant /
  non-relevant, but to highlight relevant passages in documents that it
  regards as useful. The human relevance assessors involved in creating
  this collection were given analogous instructions, i.e., they were asked
  to highlight all passages within a document that respond to the
  information need expressed in a query. This enables us to evaluate the
  quality of LLMs as judges not only at the document level, but to also
  quantify how often these `judges' are right for the right reasons.
  Our findings suggest that LLMs-as-judges work best under human
  supervision. | Sourav Saha, Mandar Mitra |
| LLMs Meet Isolation Kernel: Lightweight, Learning-free Binary Embeddings for Fast Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09159) | Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled remarkable progress in text representation. However, their embeddings are typically high-dimensional, leading to substantial storage and retrieval overhead. Although recent approaches such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) alleviate these issues to some extent, they still suffer from retrieval accuracy degradation. This paper proposes \emph{Isolation Kernel Embedding} or IKE, a learning-free method that transforms an LLM embedding into a binary embedding using Isolation Kernel (IK). IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows. Lightweight and based on binary encoding, it offers low memory footprint and fast bitwise computation, lowering retrieval latency. Experiments on multiple text retrieval datasets demonstrate that IKE offers up to 16.7x faster retrieval and 16x lower memory usage than LLM embeddings, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. Compared to CSR and other compression methods, IKE consistently achieves the best balance between retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. | Zhibo Zhang, Yang Xu, Kai Ming Ting, Cam-Tu Nguyen |
| Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478) | Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

| Unifying Search and Recommendation in LLMs via Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09496](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09496) | Search and recommendation (S&amp;R) are core to online platforms, addressing explicit intent through queries and modeling implicit intent from behaviors, respectively. Their complementary roles motivate a unified modeling paradigm. Early studies to unify S&amp;R adopt shared encoders with task-specific heads, while recent efforts reframe item ranking in both S&amp;R as conditional generation. The latter holds particular promise, enabling end-to-end optimization and leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs. However, existing methods rely on full fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and limits scalability. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers a more practical alternative but faces two critical challenges in unifying S&amp;R: (1) gradient conflicts across tasks due to divergent optimization objectives, and (2) shifts in user intent understanding caused by overfitting to fine-tuning data, which distort general-domain knowledge and weaken LLM reasoning. To address the above issues, we propose Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning (GEMS), a novel framework that unifies S&amp;R with LLMs while alleviating gradient conflicts and preserving general-domain knowledge. GEMS introduces (1) \textbf{Multi-Subspace Decomposition}, which disentangles shared and task-specific optimization signals into complementary low-rank subspaces, thereby reducing destructive gradient interference, and (2) \textbf{Null-Space Projection}, which constrains parameter updates to a subspace orthogonal to the general-domain knowledge space, mitigating shifts in user intent understanding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that GEMS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across both search and recommendation tasks, achieving superior effectiveness. | Jujia Zhao, Zihan Wang, Shuaiqun Pan, Suzan Verberne, Zhaochun Ren |
| MM-BRIGHT: A Multi-Task Multimodal Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09562](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09562) | Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of text-based queries where keyword or semantic matching is usually sufficient. Many real-world queries contain multimodal elements, particularly, images such as diagrams, charts, and screenshots that require intensive reasoning to identify relevant documents. To address this gap, we introduce MM-BRIGHT, the first multimodal benchmark for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Our dataset consists of 2,803 real-world queries spanning 29 diverse technical domains, with four tasks of increasing complexity: text-to-text, multimodal-to-text, multimodal-to-image, and multimodal-to-multimodal retrieval. Extensive evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle across all tasks: BM25 achieves only 8.5 nDCG@10 on text-only retrieval, while the best multimodal model Nomic-Vision reaches just 27.6 nDCG@10 on multimodal-to-text retrieval actually underperforming the best text-only model (DiVeR: 32.2). These results highlight substantial headroom and position MM-BRIGHT as a testbed for next-generation retrieval models that better integrate visual reasoning.

| MMGRec: Multimodal Generative Recommendation with Transformer Model | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16555](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16555) | Multimodal recommendation aims to recommend user-preferred candidates based on her/his historically interacted items and associated multimodal information. Previous studies commonly employ an embed-and-retrieve paradigm: learning user and item representations in the same embedding space, then retrieving similar candidate items for a user via embedding inner product. However, this paradigm suffers from inference cost, interaction modeling, and false-negative issues. Toward this end, we propose a new MMGRec model to introduce a generative paradigm into multimodal recommendation. Specifically, we first devise a hierarchical quantization method Graph RQ-VAE to assign Rec-ID for each item from its multimodal and CF information. Consisting of a tuple of semantically meaningful tokens, Rec-ID serves as the unique identifier of each item. Afterward, we train a Transformer-based recommender to generate the Rec-IDs of user-preferred items based on historical interaction sequences. The generative paradigm is qualified since this model systematically predicts the tuple of tokens identifying the recommended item in an autoregressive manner. Moreover, a relation-aware self-attention mechanism is devised for the Transformer to handle non-sequential interaction sequences, which explores the element pairwise relation to replace absolute positional encoding. Extensive experiments evaluate MMGRec's effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art methods. | Han Liu, Yinwei Wei, Xuemeng Song, Weili Guan, Yuan-Fang Li, Liqiang Nie |
| Revisiting Human-vs-LLM judgments using the TREC Podcast Track | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05603](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05603) | Using large language models (LLMs) to annotate relevance is an increasingly important technique in the information retrieval community. While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors. Our results reinforce the previous insights of Sormunen in 2002 -- that relying on a single assessor leads to lower user agreement. | Watheq Mansour, J.

| The Agentic Leash: Extracting Causal Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00097](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00097) | We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system. | Akash Kumar Panda, Olaoluwa Adigun, Bart Kosko |

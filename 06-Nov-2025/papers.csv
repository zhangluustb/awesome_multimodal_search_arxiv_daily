Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations with Vision-Language Models and Information-Aware Fusion,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02113,"Recent advances in multimodal recommendation (MMR) have shown that incorporating rich content sources such as images and text can lead to significant gains representation quality. However, existing methods often rely on coarse visual features and uncontrolled fusion, leading to redundant or misaligned representations. As a result, visual encoders often fail to capture salient, item-relevant semantics, limiting their contribution in multimodal fusion. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should balance the unique, shared, and redundant information across modalities, preserving complementary cues while avoiding correlation bias. This paper presents VLIF, a vision-language and information-theoretic fusion framework that enhances multimodal recommendation through two key components. (i) A VLM-based visual enrichment module generates fine-grained, title-guided descriptions to transform product images into semantically aligned representations. (ii) An information-aware fusion module, inspired by Partial Information Decomposition (PID), disentangles redundant and synergistic signals across modalities for controlled integration. Experiments on three Amazon datasets demonstrate that VLIF consistently outperforms recent multimodal baselines and substantially strengthens the contribution of visual features.","Hai-Dang Kieu, Min Xu, Thanh Trung Huynh, Dung D.

Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358,"Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.","Wongyu Kim, Hochang Lee, Sanghak Lee, Yoonsung Kim, Jaehyun Park"
Diffusion Generative Recommendation with Continuous Tokens,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007,"Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems (RecSys). Most existing LLM-based RecSys approaches operate in a discrete space, using vector-quantized tokenizers to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, these quantization methods often result in lossy tokenization and suboptimal learning, primarily due to inaccurate gradient propagation caused by the non-differentiable argmin operation in standard vector quantization. Inspired by the emerging trend of embracing continuous tokens in language models, we propose ContRec, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates continuous tokens into LLM-based RecSys. Specifically, ContRec consists of two key modules: a sigma-VAE Tokenizer, which encodes users/items with continuous tokens; and a Dispersive Diffusion module, which captures implicit user preference. The tokenizer is trained with a continuous Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) objective, where three effective techniques are adopted to avoid representation collapse. By conditioning on the previously generated tokens of the LLM backbone during user modeling, the Dispersive Diffusion module performs a conditional diffusion process with a novel Dispersive Loss, enabling high-quality user preference generation through next-token diffusion. Finally, ContRec leverages both the textual reasoning output from the LLM and the latent representations produced by the diffusion model for Top-K item retrieval, thereby delivering comprehensive recommendation results. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that ContRec consistently outperforms both traditional and SOTA LLM-based recommender systems. Our results highlight the potential of continuous tokenization and generative modeling for advancing the next generation of recommender systems.","Haohao Qu, Shanru Lin, Yujuan Ding, Yiqi Wang, Wenqi Fan"
CAT-ID$^2$: Category-Tree Integrated Document Identifier Learning for Generative Retrieval In E-commerce,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01461,"Generative retrieval (GR) has gained significant attention as an effective paradigm that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It generally consists of two stages: constructing discrete semantic identifiers (IDs) for documents and retrieving documents by autoregressively generating ID tokens. The core challenge in GR is how to construct document IDs (DocIDS) with strong representational power. Good IDs should exhibit two key properties: similar documents should have more similar IDs, and each document should maintain a distinct and unique ID. However, most existing methods ignore native category information, which is common and critical in E-commerce. Therefore, we propose a novel ID learning method, CAtegory-Tree Integrated Document IDentifier (CAT-ID$^2$), incorporating prior category information into the semantic IDs. CAT-ID$^2$ includes three key modules: a Hierarchical Class Constraint Loss to integrate category information layer by layer during quantization, a Cluster Scale Constraint Loss for uniform ID token distribution, and a Dispersion Loss to improve the distinction of reconstructed documents. These components enable CAT-ID$^2$ to generate IDs that make similar documents more alike while preserving the uniqueness of different documents' representations. Extensive offline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method, with online A/B tests showing a 0.33% increase in average orders per thousand users for ambiguous intent queries and 0.24% for long-tail queries.","Xiaoyu Liu, Fuwei Zhang, Yiqing Wu, Xinyu Jia, Zenghua Xia, Fuzhen Zhuang, Zhao Zhang, Fei Jiang, Wei Lin"

Unleashing the Native Recommendation Potential: LLM-Based Generative Recommendation via Structured Term Identifiers,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06798,"Leveraging the vast open-world knowledge and understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop general-purpose, semantically-aware recommender systems has emerged as a pivotal research direction in generative recommendation. However, existing methods face bottlenecks in constructing item identifiers. Text-based methods introduce LLMs' vast output space, leading to hallucination, while methods based on Semantic IDs (SIDs) encounter a semantic gap between SIDs and LLMs' native vocabulary, requiring costly vocabulary expansion and alignment training. To address this, this paper introduces Term IDs (TIDs), defined as a set of semantically rich and standardized textual keywords, to serve as robust item identifiers. We propose GRLM, a novel framework centered on TIDs, employs Context-aware Term Generation to convert item's metadata into standardized TIDs and utilizes Integrative Instruction Fine-tuning to collaboratively optimize term internalization and sequential recommendation. Additionally, Elastic Identifier Grounding is designed for robust item mapping. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GRLM significantly outperforms baselines across multiple scenarios, pointing a promising direction for generalizable and high-performance generative recommendation systems.","Zhiyang Zhang, Junda She, Kuo Cai, Bo Chen, Shiyao Wang, Xinchen Luo, Qiang Luo, Ruiming Tang, Han Li, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou"
MMGRec: Multimodal Generative Recommendation with Transformer Model,https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16555,"Multimodal recommendation aims to recommend user-preferred candidates based on her/his historically interacted items and associated multimodal information. Previous studies commonly employ an embed-and-retrieve paradigm: learning user and item representations in the same embedding space, then retrieving similar candidate items for a user via embedding inner product. However, this paradigm suffers from inference cost, interaction modeling, and false-negative issues. Toward this end, we propose a new MMGRec model to introduce a generative paradigm into multimodal recommendation. Specifically, we first devise a hierarchical quantization method Graph RQ-VAE to assign Rec-ID for each item from its multimodal and CF information. Consisting of a tuple of semantically meaningful tokens, Rec-ID serves as the unique identifier of each item. Afterward, we train a Transformer-based recommender to generate the Rec-IDs of user-preferred items based on historical interaction sequences. The generative paradigm is qualified since this model systematically predicts the tuple of tokens identifying the recommended item in an autoregressive manner. Moreover, a relation-aware self-attention mechanism is devised for the Transformer to handle non-sequential interaction sequences, which explores the element pairwise relation to replace absolute positional encoding. Extensive experiments evaluate MMGRec's effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art methods.","Han Liu, Yinwei Wei, Xuemeng Song, Weili Guan, Yuan-Fang Li, Liqiang Nie"
TRUE: A Reproducible Framework for LLM-Driven Relevance Judgment in Information Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25602,"LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However, existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent, coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across multiple dimensions.","Mouly Dewan, Jiqun Liu, Chirag Shah"

| FeDecider: An LLM-Based Framework for Federated Cross-Domain Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16034) | Federated cross-domain recommendation (Federated CDR) aims to collaboratively learn personalized recommendation models across heterogeneous domains while preserving data privacy. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based recommendation models have demonstrated impressive performance by leveraging LLMs' strong reasoning capabilities and broad knowledge. However, adopting LLM-based recommendation models in Federated CDR scenarios introduces new challenges. First, there exists a risk of overfitting with domain-specific local adapters. The magnitudes of locally optimized parameter updates often vary across domains, causing biased aggregation and overfitting toward domain-specific distributions. Second, unlike traditional recommendation models (e.g., collaborative filtering, bipartite graph-based methods) that learn explicit and comparable user/item representations, LLMs encode knowledge implicitly through autoregressive text generation training. This poses additional challenges for effectively measuring the cross-domain similarities under heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based framework for federated cross-domain recommendation, FeDecider. Specifically, FeDecider tackles the challenge of scale-specific noise by disentangling each client's low-rank updates and sharing only their directional components. To handle the need for flexible and effective integration, each client further learns personalized weights that achieve the data-aware integration of updates from other domains. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed FeDecider. | Xinrui He, Ting-Wei Li, Tianxin Wei, Xuying Ning, Xinyu He, Wenxuan Bao, Hanghang Tong, Jingrui He |
| Campaign-2-PT-RAG: LLM-Guided Semantic Product Type Attribution for Scalable Campaign Ranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10577](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10577) | E-commerce campaign ranking models require large-scale training labels indicating which users purchased due to campaign influence. However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present Campaign-2-PT-RAG, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user-campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments. Experiments on internal and synthetic datasets, validated against expert-annotated campaign-PT mappings, show that our LLM-assisted approach generates high-quality labels with 78-90% precision while maintaining over 99% recall. | Yiming Che, Mansi Ranjit Mane, Keerthi Gopalakrishnan, Parisa Kaghazgaran, Murali Mohana Krishna Dandu, Archana Venkatachalapathy, Sinduja Subramaniam, Yokila Arora, Evren Korpeoglu, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan |
| Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation Framework with Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization for Robust Early Pancreatic Neoplasm Detection in Multimodal CT Imaging | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23597](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23597) | The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors. | Janani Annur Thiruvengadam, Kiran Mayee Nabigaru, Anusha Kovi |

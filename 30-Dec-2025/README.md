| Selective LLM-Guided Regularization for Enhancing Recommendation Models | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21526](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21526) | Large language models provide rich semantic priors and strong reasoning capabilities, making them promising auxiliary signals for recommendation. However, prevailing approaches either deploy LLMs as standalone recommender or apply global knowledge distillation, both of which suffer from inherent drawbacks. Standalone LLM recommender are costly, biased, and unreliable across large regions of the user item space, while global distillation forces the downstream model to imitate LLM predictions even when such guidance is inaccurate. Meanwhile, recent studies show that LLMs excel particularly in re-ranking and challenging scenarios, rather than uniformly across all contexts.We introduce Selective LLM Guided Regularization, a model-agnostic and computation efficient framework that activates LLM based pairwise ranking supervision only when a trainable gating mechanism informing by user history length, item popularity, and model uncertainty predicts the LLM to be reliable. All LLM scoring is performed offline, transferring knowledge without increasing inference cost. Experiments across multiple datasets show that this selective strategy consistently improves overall accuracy and yields substantial gains in cold start and long tail regimes, outperforming global distillation baselines. | Shanglin Yang, Zhan Shi |
| CEMG: Collaborative-Enhanced Multimodal Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21543) | Generative recommendation models often struggle with two key challenges: (1) the superficial integration of collaborative signals, and (2) the decoupled fusion of multimodal features. These limitations hinder the creation of a truly holistic item representation. To overcome this, we propose CEMG, a novel Collaborative-Enhaned Multimodal Generative Recommendation framework. Our approach features a Multimodal Fusion Layer that dynamically integrates visual and textual features under the guidance of collaborative signals. Subsequently, a Unified Modality Tokenization stage employs a Residual Quantization VAE (RQ-VAE) to convert this fused representation into discrete semantic codes. Finally, in the End-to-End Generative Recommendation stage, a large language model is fine-tuned to autoregressively generate these item codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEMG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. | Yuzhen Lin, Hongyi Chen, Xuanjing Chen, Shaowen Wang, Ivonne Xu, Dongming Jiang |
| LLM-I2I: Boost Your Small Item2Item Recommendation Model with Large Language Model | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21595](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21595) | Item-to-Item (I2I) recommendation models are widely used in real-world systems due to their scalability, real-time capabilities, and high recommendation quality. Research to enhance I2I performance focuses on two directions: 1) model-centric approaches, which adopt deeper architectures but risk increased computational costs and deployment complexity, and 2) data-centric methods, which refine training data without altering models, offering cost-effectiveness but struggling with data sparsity and noise. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-I2I, a data-centric framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate data quality issues. LLM-I2I includes (1) an LLM-based generator that synthesizes user-item interactions for long-tail items, alleviating data sparsity, and (2) an LLM-based discriminator that filters noisy interactions from real and synthetic data. The refined data is then fused to train I2I models. Evaluated on industry (AEDS) and academic (ARD) datasets, LLM-I2I consistently improves recommendation accuracy, particularly for long-tail items. Deployed on a large-scale cross-border e-commerce platform, it boosts recall number (RN) by 6.02% and gross merchandise value (GMV) by 1.22% over existing I2I models. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in enhancing data-centric recommendation systems without modifying model architectures. | Yinfu Feng, Yanjing Wu, Rong Xiao, Xiaoyi Zen |
| Ensembling Multiple Hallucination Detectors Trained on VLLM Internal Representations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14330](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14330) | This paper presents the 5th place solution by our team, y3h2, for the Meta CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025. The CRAG-MM benchmark is a visual question answering (VQA) dataset focused on factual questions about images, including egocentric images. The competition was contested based on VQA accuracy, as judged by an LLM-based automatic evaluator. Since incorrect answers result in negative scores, our strategy focused on reducing hallucinations from the internal representations of the VLM. Specifically, we trained logistic regression-based hallucination detection models using both the hidden_state and the outputs of specific attention heads. We then employed an ensemble of these models. As a result, while our method sacrificed some correct answers, it significantly reduced hallucinations and allowed us to place among the top entries on the final leaderboard. | Yuto Nakamizo, Ryuhei Miyazato, Hikaru Tanabe, Ryuta Yamakura, Kiori Hatanaka |

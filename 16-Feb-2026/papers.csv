RQ-GMM: Residual Quantized Gaussian Mixture Model for Multimodal Semantic Discretization in CTR Prediction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12593,"Multimodal content is crucial for click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, directly incorporating continuous embeddings from pre-trained models into CTR models yields suboptimal results due to misaligned optimization objectives and convergence speed inconsistency during joint training. Discretizing embeddings into semantic IDs before feeding them into CTR models offers a more effective solution, yet existing methods suffer from limited codebook utilization, reconstruction accuracy, and semantic discriminability. We propose RQ-GMM (Residual Quantized Gaussian Mixture Model), which introduces probabilistic modeling to better capture the statistical structure of multimodal embedding spaces. Through Gaussian Mixture Models combined with residual quantization, RQ-GMM achieves superior codebook utilization and reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on public datasets and online A/B tests on a large-scale short-video platform serving hundreds of millions of users demonstrate substantial improvements: RQ-GMM yields a 1.502% gain in Advertiser Value over strong baselines. The method has been fully deployed, serving daily recommendations for hundreds of millions of users.","Ziye Tong, Jiahao Liu, Weimin Zhang, Hongji Ruan, Derick Tang, Zhanpeng Zeng, Qinsong Zeng, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu"
Self-EvolveRec: Self-Evolving Recommender Systems with LLM-based Directional Feedback,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12612,"Traditional methods for automating recommender system design, such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS), are often constrained by a fixed search space defined by human priors, limiting innovation to pre-defined operators. While recent LLM-driven code evolution frameworks shift fixed search space target to open-ended program spaces, they primarily rely on scalar metrics (e.g., NDCG, Hit Ratio) that fail to provide qualitative insights into model failures or directional guidance for improvement. To address this, we propose Self-EvolveRec, a novel framework that establishes a directional feedback loop by integrating a User Simulator for qualitative critiques and a Model Diagnosis Tool for quantitative internal verification. Furthermore, we introduce a Diagnosis Tool - Model Co-Evolution strategy to ensure that evaluation criteria dynamically adapt as the recommendation architecture evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Self-EvolveRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art NAS and LLM-driven code evolution baselines in both recommendation performance and user satisfaction.

"WISE: A Multimodal Search Engine for Visual Scenes, Audio, Objects, Faces, Speech, and Metadata",https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12819,"In this paper, we present WISE, an open-source audiovisual search engine which integrates a range of multimodal retrieval capabilities into a single, practical tool accessible to users without machine learning expertise. WISE supports natural-language and reverse-image queries at both the scene level (e.g. empty street) and object level (e.g. horse) across images and videos; face-based search for specific individuals; audio retrieval of acoustic events using text (e.g. wood creak) or an audio file; search over automatically transcribed speech; and filtering by user-provided metadata. Rich insights can be obtained by combining queries across modalities -- for example, retrieving German trains from a historical archive by applying the object query ""train"" and the metadata query ""Germany"", or searching for a face in a place. By employing vector search techniques, WISE can scale to support efficient retrieval over millions of images or thousands of hours of video. Its modular architecture facilitates the integration of new models. WISE can be deployed locally for private or sensitive collections, and has been applied to various real-world use cases. Our code is open-source and available at https://gitlab.com/vgg/wise/wise.","Prasanna Sridhar, Horace Lee, David M. S. Pinto, Andrew Zisserman, Abhishek Dutta"
Awakening Dormant Users: Generative Recommendation with Counterfactual Functional Role Reasoning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13134,"Awakening dormant users, who remain engaged but exhibit low conversion, is a pivotal driver for incremental GMV growth in large-scale e-commerce platforms. However, existing approaches often yield suboptimal results since they typically rely on single-step estimation of an item's intrinsic value (e.g., immediate click probability). This mechanism overlooks the instrumental effect of items, where specific interactions act as triggers to shape latent intent and drive subsequent decisions along a conversion trajectory. To bridge this gap, we propose RoleGen, a novel framework that synergizes a Conversion Trajectory Reasoner with a Generative Behavioral Backbone. Specifically, the LLM-based Reasoner explicitly models the context-dependent Functional Role of items to reconstruct intent evolution. It further employs counterfactual inference to simulate diverse conversion paths, effectively mitigating interest collapse. These reasoned candidate items are integrated into the generative backbone, which is optimized via a collaborative ""Reasoning-Execution-Feedback-Reflection"" closed-loop strategy to ensure grounded execution. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing on the Kuaishou e-commerce platform demonstrate that RoleGen achieves a 6.2% gain in Recall@1 and a 7.3% increase in online order volume, confirming its effectiveness in activating the dormant user base.","Huishi Luo, Shuokai Li, Hanchen Yang, Zhongbo Sun, Haojie Ding, Boheng Zhang, Zijia Cai, Renliang Qian, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, Chenyi Lei, Wenwu Ou, Fuzhen Zhuang"
Asynchronous Verified Semantic Caching for Tiered LLM Architectures,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13165,"Large language models (LLMs) now sit in the critical path of search, assistance, and agentic workflows, making semantic caching essential for reducing inference cost and latency. Production deployments typically use a tiered static-dynamic design: a static cache of curated, offline vetted responses mined from logs, backed by a dynamic cache populated online. In practice, both tiers are commonly governed by a single embedding similarity threshold, which induces a hard tradeoff: conservative thresholds miss safe reuse opportunities, while aggressive thresholds risk serving semantically incorrect responses. We introduce \textbf{Krites}, an asynchronous, LLM-judged caching policy that expands static coverage without changing serving decisions. On the critical path, Krites behaves exactly like a standard static threshold policy. When the nearest static neighbor of the prompt falls just below the static threshold, Krites asynchronously invokes an LLM judge to verify whether the static response is acceptable for the new prompt. Approved matches are promoted into the dynamic cache, allowing future repeats and paraphrases to reuse curated static answers and expanding static reach over time. In trace-driven simulations on conversational and search workloads, Krites increases the fraction of requests served with curated static answers (direct static hits plus verified promotions) by up to $\textbf{3.9}$ times for conversational traffic and search-style queries relative to tuned baselines, with unchanged critical path latency.","Asmit Kumar Singh, Haozhe Wang, Laxmi Naga Santosh Attaluri, Tak Chiam, Weihua Zhu"
Fix Before Search: Benchmarking Agentic Query Visual Pre-processing in Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13179,"Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a key paradigm for grounding MLLMs with external knowledge. While query pre-processing (e.g., rewriting) is standard in text-based RAG, existing MRAG pipelines predominantly treat visual inputs as static and immutable, implicitly assuming they are noise-free. However, real-world visual queries are often ``imperfect'' -- suffering from geometric distortions, quality degradation, or semantic ambiguity -- leading to catastrophic retrieval failures. To address this gap, we propose V-QPP-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to Visual Query Pre-processing (V-QPP). We formulate V-QPP as an agentic decision-making task where MLLMs must autonomously diagnose imperfections and deploy perceptual tools to refine queries. Our extensive evaluation across 46,700 imperfect queries and diverse MRAG paradigms reveals three critical insights: (1) Vulnerability -- visual imperfections severely degrade both retrieval recall and end-to-end MRAG performance; (2) Restoration Potential \& Bottleneck -- while oracle preprocessing recovers near-perfect performance, off-the-shelf MLLMs struggle with tool selection and parameter prediction without specialized training; and (3) Training Enhancement -- supervised fine-tuning enables compact models to achieve comparable or superior performance to larger proprietary models, demonstrating the benchmark's value for developing robust MRAG systems The code is available at https://github.com/phycholosogy/VQQP_Bench","Jiankun Zhang, Shenglai Zeng, Kai Guo, Xinnan Dai, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang, Yi Chang"
Hi-SAM: A Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal Framework for Large-Scale Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11799,"Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.","Pingjun Pan, Tingting Zhou, Peiyao Lu, Tingting Fei, Hongxiang Chen, Chuanjiang Luo"
Towards Context-aware Reasoning-enhanced Generative Searching in E-commerce,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16925,"Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines, validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.","Zhiding Liu, Ben Chen, Mingyue Cheng, Enhong Chen, Li Li, Chenyi Lei, Wenwu Ou, Han Li, Kun Gai"
Principled Synthetic Data Enables the First Scaling Laws for LLMs in Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07298,"Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a promising frontier for recommender systems, yet their development has been impeded by the absence of predictable scaling laws, which are crucial for guiding research and optimizing resource allocation. We hypothesize that this may be attributed to the inherent noise, bias, and incompleteness of raw user interaction data in prior continual pre-training (CPT) efforts. This paper introduces a novel, layered framework for generating high-quality synthetic data that circumvents such issues by creating a curated, pedagogical curriculum for the LLM. We provide powerful, direct evidence for the utility of our curriculum by showing that standard sequential models trained on our principled synthetic data significantly outperform ($+130\%$ on recall@100 for SasRec) models trained on real data in downstream ranking tasks, demonstrating its superiority for learning generalizable user preference patterns. Building on this, we empirically demonstrate, for the first time, robust power-law scaling for an LLM that is continually pre-trained on our high-quality, recommendation-specific data. Our experiments reveal consistent and predictable perplexity reduction across multiple synthetic data modalities. These findings establish a foundational methodology for reliable scaling LLM capabilities in the recommendation domain, thereby shifting the research focus from mitigating data deficiencies to leveraging high-quality, structured information.","Benyu Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Jianpeng Cheng, Hong-You Chen, Qifei Wang, Wei Sun, Shen Li, Jia Li, Jiahao Wu, Xiangjun Fan, Hong Yan"
MLDocRAG: Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10271,"Understanding multimodal long-context documents that comprise multimodal chunks such as paragraphs, figures, and tables is challenging due to (1) cross-modal heterogeneity to localize relevant information across modalities, (2) cross-page reasoning to aggregate dispersed evidence across pages. To address these challenges, we are motivated to adopt a query-centric formulation that projects cross-modal and cross-page information into a unified query representation space, with queries acting as abstract semantic surrogates for heterogeneous multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation (MLDocRAG) framework that leverages a Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG) to organize multimodal document content around semantically rich, answerable queries. MCQG is constructed via a multimodal document expansion process that generates fine-grained queries from heterogeneous document chunks and links them to their corresponding content across modalities and pages. This graph-based structure enables selective, query-centric retrieval and structured evidence aggregation, thereby enhancing grounding and coherence in multimodal long-context question answering. Experiments on datasets MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL demonstrate that MLDocRAG consistently improves retrieval quality and answer accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for multimodal long-context understanding.","Yongyue Zhang, Yaxiong Wu"
Recurrent Preference Memory for Efficient Long-Sequence Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11605,"Generative recommendation (GenRec) models typically model user behavior via full attention, but scaling to lifelong sequences is hindered by prohibitive computational costs and noise accumulation from stochastic interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce Rec2PM, a framework that compresses long user interaction histories into compact Preference Memory tokens. Unlike traditional recurrent methods that suffer from serial training, Rec2PM employs a novel self-referential teacher-forcing strategy: it leverages a global view of the history to generate reference memories, which serve as supervision targets for parallelized recurrent updates. This allows for fully parallel training while maintaining the capability for iterative updates during inference. Additionally, by representing memory as token embeddings rather than extensive KV caches, Rec2PM achieves extreme storage efficiency. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks show that Rec2PM significantly reduces inference latency and memory footprint while achieving superior accuracy compared to full-sequence models. Analysis reveals that the Preference Memory functions as a denoising Information Bottleneck, effectively filtering interaction noise to capture robust long-term interests.","Yixiao Chen, Yuan Wang, Yue Liu, Qiyao Wang, Ke Cheng, Xin Xu, Juntong Yan, Shuojin Yang, Menghao Guo, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu, Jie Jiang"

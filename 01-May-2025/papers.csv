"Don't Retrieve, Generate: Prompting LLMs for Synthetic Training Data in Dense Retrieval",https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21015,"Training effective dense retrieval models often relies on hard negative (HN) examples mined from the document corpus via methods like BM25 or cross-encoders (CE), processes that can be computationally demanding and require full corpus access. This paper introduces a different approach, an end-to-end pipeline where a Large Language Model (LLM) first generates a query from a passage, and then generates a hard negative example using \emph{only} that query text. This corpus-free negative generation contrasts with standard mining techniques. We evaluated this \textsc{LLM Query $\rightarrow$ LLM HN} approach against traditional \textsc{LLM Query $\rightarrow$ BM25 HN} and \textsc{LLM Query $\rightarrow$ CE HN} pipelines using E5-Base and GTE-Base models on several BEIR benchmark datasets. Our results show the proposed all-LLM pipeline achieves performance identical to both the BM25 and the computationally intensive CE baselines across nDCG@10, Precision@10, and Recall@100 metrics. This demonstrates that our corpus-free negative generation method matches the effectiveness of complex, corpus-dependent mining techniques, offering a potentially simpler and more efficient pathway for training high-performance retrievers without sacrificing results. We make the dataset including the queries and the hard-negatives for all three methods publicly available https://huggingface.co/collections/chungimungi/arxiv-hard-negatives-68027bbc601ff6cc8eb1f449.",Aarush Sinha
In a Few Words: Comparing Weak Supervision and LLMs for Short Query Intent Classification,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21398,"User intent classification is an important task in information retrieval. Previously, user intents were classified manually and automatically; the latter helped to avoid hand labelling of large datasets. Recent studies explored whether LLMs can reliably determine user intent. However, researchers have recognized the limitations of using generative LLMs for classification tasks. In this study, we empirically compare user intent classification into informational, navigational, and transactional categories, using weak supervision and LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct for in-context learning and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct for fine-tuning, comparing their performance to an established baseline classifier trained using weak supervision (ORCAS-I). Our results indicate that while LLMs outperform weak supervision in recall, they continue to struggle with precision, which shows the need for improved methods to balance both metrics effectively.","Daria Alexander, Arjen P. de Vries"
RDF-Based Structured Quality Assessment Representation of Multilingual LLM Evaluations,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21605,"Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly serve as knowledge interfaces, yet systematically assessing their reliability with conflicting information remains difficult. We propose an RDF-based framework to assess multilingual LLM quality, focusing on knowledge conflicts. Our approach captures model responses across four distinct context conditions (complete, incomplete, conflicting, and no-context information) in German and English. This structured representation enables the comprehensive analysis of knowledge leakage-where models favor training data over provided context-error detection, and multilingual consistency. We demonstrate the framework through a fire safety domain experiment, revealing critical patterns in context prioritization and language-specific performance, and demonstrating that our vocabulary was sufficient to express every assessment facet encountered in the 28-question study.","Jonas Gwozdz, Andreas Both"
MSL: Not All Tokens Are What You Need for Tuning LLM as a Recommender,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04178,"Large language models (LLMs), known for their comprehension capabilities and extensive knowledge, have been increasingly applied to recommendation systems (RS). Given the fundamental gap between the mechanism of LLMs and the requirement of RS, researchers have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with recommendation-specific data to enhance their performance. Language Modeling Loss (LML), originally designed for language generation tasks, is commonly adopted. However, we identify two critical limitations of LML: 1) it exhibits significant divergence from the recommendation objective; 2) it erroneously treats all fictitious item descriptions as negative samples, introducing misleading training signals.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel Masked Softmax Loss (MSL) tailored for fine-tuning LLMs on recommendation. MSL improves LML by identifying and masking invalid tokens that could lead to fictitious item descriptions during loss computation. This strategy can effectively avoid the interference from erroneous negative signals and ensure well alignment with the recommendation objective supported by theoretical guarantees. During implementation, we identify a potential challenge related to gradient vanishing of MSL. To overcome this, we further introduce the temperature coefficient and propose an Adaptive Temperature Strategy (ATS) that adaptively adjusts the temperature without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets further validate the effectiveness of MSL, achieving an average improvement of 42.24% in NDCG@10.

"PinRec: Outcome-Conditioned, Multi-Token Generative Retrieval for Industry-Scale Recommendation Systems",https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10507,"Generative retrieval methods utilize generative sequential modeling techniques, such as transformers, to generate candidate items for recommender systems. These methods have demonstrated promising results in academic benchmarks, surpassing traditional retrieval models like two-tower architectures. However, current generative retrieval methods lack the scalability required for industrial recommender systems, and they are insufficiently flexible to satisfy the multiple metric requirements of modern systems. This paper introduces PinRec, a novel generative retrieval model developed for applications at Pinterest. PinRec utilizes outcome-conditioned generation, enabling modelers to specify how to balance various outcome metrics, such as the number of saves and clicks, to effectively align with business goals and user exploration. Additionally, PinRec incorporates multi-token generation to enhance output diversity while optimizing generation. Our experiments demonstrate that PinRec can successfully balance performance, diversity, and efficiency, delivering a significant positive impact to users using generative models. This paper marks a significant milestone in generative retrieval, as it presents, to our knowledge, the first rigorous study on implementing generative retrieval at the scale of Pinterest.","Anirudhan Badrinath, Prabhat Agarwal, Laksh Bhasin, Jaewon Yang, Jiajing Xu, Charles Rosenberg"

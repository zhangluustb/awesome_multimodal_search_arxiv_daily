| Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21460) | In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module, and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities, improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing multi-modal recommendation systems.

| DMGIN: How Multimodal LLMs Enhance Large Recommendation Models for Lifelong User Post-click Behaviors | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21801) | Modeling user interest based on lifelong user behavior sequences is crucial for enhancing Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. However, long post-click behavior sequences themselves pose severe performance issues: the sheer volume of data leads to high computational costs and inefficiencies in model training and inference. Traditional methods address this by introducing two-stage approaches, but this compromises model effectiveness due to incomplete utilization of the full sequence context. More importantly, integrating multimodal embeddings into existing large recommendation models (LRM) presents significant challenges: These embeddings often exacerbate computational burdens and mismatch with LRM architectures. To address these issues and enhance the model's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest Network (DMGIN). Given the observation that user post-click behavior sequences contain a large number of repeated items with varying behaviors and timestamps, DMGIN employs Multimodal LLMs(MLLM) for grouping to reorganize complete lifelong post-click behavior sequences more effectively, with almost no additional computational overhead, as opposed to directly introducing multimodal embeddings. To mitigate the potential information loss from grouping, we have implemented two key strategies. First, we analyze behaviors within each group using both interest statistics and intra-group transformers to capture group traits. Second, apply inter-group transformers to temporally ordered groups to capture the evolution of user group interests. Our extensive experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of DMGIN. The A/B test in our LBS advertising system shows that DMGIN improves CTR by 4.7% and Revenue per Mile by 2.3%. | Zhuoxing Wei, Qingchen Xie, Qi Liu |
| Uncertainty-Aware Semantic Decoding for LLM-Based Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07210](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07210) | Large language models have been widely applied to sequential recommendation tasks, yet during inference, they continue to rely on decoding strategies developed for natural language processing. This creates a mismatch between text-generation objectives and recommendation next item selection objectives. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing an Uncertainty-aware Semantic Decoding (USD) framework that combines logit-based clustering with adaptive scoring to improve next-item predictions. Our approach clusters items with similar logit vectors into semantic equivalence groups, then redistributes probability mass within these clusters and computes entropy across them to control item scoring and sampling temperature during recommendation inference. Experiments on Amazon Product datasets (six domains) gains of 18.5\% in HR@3, 11.9\% in NDCG@3, and 10.8\% in MRR@3 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Hyperparameter analysis confirms the optimal parameters among various settings, and experiments on H\&amp;M, and Netflix datasets indicate that the framework can adapt to differing recommendation domains. The experimental results confirm that integrating semantic clustering and uncertainty assessment yields more reliable and accurate recommendations. | Chenke Yin, Li Fan, Jia Wang, Dongxiao Hu, Haichao Zhang, Chong Zhang, Yang Xiang |

Grocery to General Merchandise: A Cross-Pollination Recommender using LLMs and Real-Time Cart Context,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02890,"Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However, recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping -- such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP) framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader insights for e-commerce systems.","Akshay Kekuda, Murali Mohana Krishna Dandu, Rimita Lahiri, Shiqin Cai, Sinduja Subramaniam, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan"
Knowledge graph-based personalized multimodal recommendation fusion framework,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02943,"In the contemporary age characterized by information abundance, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have rendered recommendation systems indispensable. Conventional recommendation methodologies based on collaborative filtering or individual attributes encounter deficiencies in capturing nuanced user interests. Knowledge graphs and multimodal data integration offer enhanced representations of users and items with greater richness and precision. This paper reviews existing multimodal knowledge graph recommendation frameworks, identifying shortcomings in modal interaction and higher-order dependency modeling. We propose the Cross-Graph Cross-Modal Mutual Information-Driven Unified Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation Framework (CrossGMMI-DUKGLR), which employs pre-trained visual-text alignment models for feature extraction, achieves fine-grained modality fusion through multi-head cross-attention, and propagates higher-order adjacency information via graph attention networks.",Yu Fang
RecBase: Generative Foundation Model Pretraining for Zero-Shot Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03131,"Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods, relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our 1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.","Sashuai Zhou, Weinan Gan, Qijiong Liu, Ke Lei, Jieming Zhu, Hai Huang, Yan Xia, Ruiming Tang, Zhenhua Dong, Zhou Zhao"
OneSearch: A Preliminary Exploration of the Unified End-to-End Generative Framework for E-commerce Search,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03236,"Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose \textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE) module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR, +2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from 3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of millions of PVs daily.","Ben Chen, Xian Guo, Siyuan Wang, Zihan Liang, Yue Lv, Yufei Ma, Xinlong Xiao, Bowen Xue, Xuxin Zhang, Ying Yang, Huangyu Dai, Xing Xu, Tong Zhao, Mingcan Peng, Xiaoyang Zheng, Chao Wang, Qihang Zhao, Zhixin Zhai, Yang Zhao, Bochao Liu, Jingshan Lv, Jing Chen, Xiao Liang, Yuqing Ding, Chenyi Lei, Wenwu Ou, Han Li, Kun Gai"
OpenAIs HealthBench in Action: Evaluating an LLM-Based Medical Assistant on Realistic Clinical Queries,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02594,"Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems behave in complex, high-stake clincal scenarios. Traditional evaluations are often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential competencies such as contextual reasoning, awareness and uncertainty handling etc. To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic, RAG-based clinical support assistant, DR.INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR.INFO achieves a HealthBench score of 0.51, substantially outperforming leading frontier LLMs (GPT-5, o3, Grok 3, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, etc.) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness, instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence, Pathway.md), it maintains a performance lead with a health-bench score of 0.54. These results highlight DR.INFOs strengths in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and completeness of a response. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level, rubric-based evaluation for building a reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled clinical support assistant.","Sandhanakrishnan Ravichandran, Shivesh Kumar, Rogerio Corga Da Silva, Miguel Romano, Reinhard Berkels, Michiel van der Heijden, Olivier Fail, Valentine Emmanuel Gnanapragasam"
Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional Reconstruction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03020,"Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.","Chang Su, Dengliang Shi, Siyuan Huang, Jintao Du, Changhua Meng, Yu Cheng, Weiqiang Wang, Zhouhan Lin"

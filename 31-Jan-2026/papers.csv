"OneMall: One Model, More Scenarios -- End-to-End Generative Recommender Family at Kuaishou E-Commerce",https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21770,"In the wave of generative recommendation, we present OneMall, an end-to-end generative recommendation framework tailored for e-commerce services at Kuaishou. Our OneMall systematically unifies the e-commerce's multiple item distribution scenarios, such as Product-card, short-video and live-streaming. Specifically, it comprises three key components, aligning the entire model training pipeline to the LLM's pre-training/post-training: (1) E-commerce Semantic Tokenizer: we provide a tokenizer solution that captures both real-world semantics and business-specific item relations across different scenarios; (2) Transformer-based Architecture: we largely utilize Transformer as our model backbone, e.g., employing Query-Former for long sequence compression, Cross-Attention for multi-behavior sequence fusion, and Sparse MoE for scalable auto-regressive generation; (3) Reinforcement Learning Pipeline: we further connect retrieval and ranking models via RL, enabling the ranking model to serve as a reward signal for end-to-end policy retrieval model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneMall achieves consistent improvements across all e-commerce scenarios: +13.01\% GMV in product-card, +15.32\% Orders in Short-Video, and +2.78\% Orders in Live-Streaming. OneMall has been deployed, serving over 400 million daily active users at Kuaishou.","Kun Zhang, Jingming Zhang, Wei Cheng, Yansong Cheng, Jiaqi Zhang, Hao Lu, Xu Zhang, Haixiang Gan, Jiangxia Cao, Tenglong Wang, Ximing Zhang, Boyang Xia, Kuo Cai, Shiyao Wang, Hongjian Dou, Jinkai Yu, Mingxing Wen, Qiang Luo, Dongxu Liang, Chenyi Lei, Jun Wang, Runan Liu, Zhaojie Liu, Ruiming Tang, Tingting Gao, Shaoguo Liu, Yuqing Ding, Hui Kong, Han Li, Guorui Zhou, Wenwu Ou, Kun Gai"
SpecTran: Spectral-Aware Transformer-based Adapter for LLM-Enhanced Sequential Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21986,"Traditional sequential recommendation (SR) models learn low-dimensional item ID embeddings from user-item interactions, often overlooking textual information such as item titles or descriptions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have inspired a surge of research that encodes item textual information with high-dimensional semantic embeddings, and designs transformation methods to inject such embeddings into SR models. These embedding transformation strategies can be categorized into two types, both of which exhibits notable drawbacks: 1) adapter-based methods suffer from pronounced dimension collapse, concentrating information into a few dominant dimensions; 2) SVD-based methods are rigid and manual, considering only a few principal spectral components while discarding rich information in the remaining spectrum.
  To address these limitations, we propose SpecTran, a spectral-aware transformer-based adapter that operates in the spectral domain, attending to the full spectrum to select and aggregates informative components. A learnable spectral-position encoding injects singular-value cues as an inductive bias, guiding attention toward salient spectral components and promoting diversity across embedding dimensions. Across four real-world datasets and three SR backbones, it consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average improvement of 9.17%.","Yu Cui, Feng Liu, Zhaoxiang Wang, Changwang Zhang, Jun Wang, Can Wang, Jiawei Chen"
LANCER: LLM Reranking for Nugget Coverage,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22008,"Unlike short-form retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), such as factoid question answering, long-form RAG requires retrieval to provide documents covering a wide range of relevant information. Automated report generation exemplifies this setting: it requires not only relevant information but also a more elaborate response with comprehensive information. Yet, existing retrieval methods are primarily optimized for relevance ranking rather than information coverage. To address this limitation, we propose LANCER, an LLM-based reranking method for nugget coverage. LANCER predicts what sub-questions should be answered to satisfy an information need, predicts which documents answer these sub-questions, and reranks documents in order to provide a ranked list covering as many information nuggets as possible. Our empirical results show that LANCER enhances the quality of retrieval as measured by nugget coverage metrics, achieving higher $\alpha$-nDCG and information coverage than other LLM-based reranking methods. Our oracle analysis further reveals that sub-question generation plays an essential role.","Jia-Huei Ju, Fran\c{c}ois G. Landry, Eugene Yang, Suzan Verberne, Andrew Yates"
Fake News Detection After LLM Laundering: Measurement and Explanation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18649,"With their advanced capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate highly convincing and contextually relevant fake news, which can contribute to disseminating misinformation. Though there is much research on fake news detection for human-written text, the field of detecting LLM-generated fake news is still under-explored. This research measures the efficacy of detectors in identifying LLM-paraphrased fake news, in particular, determining whether adding a paraphrase step in the detection pipeline helps or impedes detection. This study contributes: (1) Detectors struggle to detect LLM-paraphrased fake news more than human-written text, (2) We find which models excel at which tasks (evading detection, paraphrasing to evade detection, and paraphrasing for semantic similarity). (3) Via LIME explanations, we discovered a possible reason for detection failures: sentiment shift. (4) We discover a worrisome trend for paraphrase quality measurement: samples that exhibit sentiment shift despite a high BERTSCORE. (5) We provide a pair of datasets augmenting existing datasets with paraphrase outputs and scores. The dataset is available on GitHub","Rupak Kumar Das, Jonathan Dodge"
Toward Culturally Aligned LLMs through Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21700,"Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly support culturally sensitive decision making, yet often exhibit misalignment due to skewed pretraining data and the absence of structured value representations. Existing methods can steer outputs, but often lack demographic grounding and treat values as independent, unstructured signals, reducing consistency and interpretability. We propose OG-MAR, an Ontology-Guided Multi-Agent Reasoning framework. OG-MAR summarizes respondent-specific values from the World Values Survey (WVS) and constructs a global cultural ontology by eliciting relations over a fixed taxonomy via competency questions. At inference time, it retrieves ontology-consistent relations and demographically similar profiles to instantiate multiple value-persona agents, whose outputs are synthesized by a judgment agent that enforces ontology consistency and demographic proximity. Experiments on regional social-survey benchmarks across four LLM backbones show that OG-MAR improves cultural alignment and robustness over competitive baselines, while producing more transparent reasoning traces.","Wonduk Seo, Wonseok Choi, Junseo Koh, Juhyeon Lee, Hyunjin An, Minhyeong Yu, Jian Park, Qingshan Zhou, Seunghyun Lee, Yi Bu"
"When ""Better"" Prompts Hurt: Evaluation-Driven Iteration for LLM Applications",https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22025,"Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications differs from traditional software testing because outputs are stochastic, high-dimensional, and sensitive to prompt and model changes. We present an evaluation-driven workflow - Define, Test, Diagnose, Fix - that turns these challenges into a repeatable engineering loop.
  We introduce the Minimum Viable Evaluation Suite (MVES), a tiered set of recommended evaluation components for (i) general LLM applications, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and (iii) agentic tool-use workflows. We also synthesize common evaluation methods (automated checks, human rubrics, and LLM-as-judge) and discuss known judge failure modes.
  In reproducible local experiments (Ollama; Llama 3 8B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct), we observe that a generic ""improved"" prompt template can trade off behaviors: on our small structured suites, extraction pass rate decreased from 100% to 90% and RAG compliance from 93.3% to 80% for Llama 3 when replacing task-specific prompts with generic rules, while instruction-following improved. These findings motivate evaluation-driven prompt iteration and careful claim calibration rather than universal prompt recipes.
  All test suites, harnesses, and results are included for reproducibility.",Daniel Commey
Rec-R1: Bridging Generative Large Language Models and User-Centric Recommendation Systems via Reinforcement Learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24289,"We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.","Jiacheng Lin, Tian Wang, Kun Qian"
MMGRid: Navigating Temporal-aware and Cross-domain Generative Recommendation via Model Merging,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15930,"Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.","Tianjun Wei, Enneng Yang, Yingpeng Du, Huizhong Guo, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun"
RobustExplain: Evaluating Robustness of LLM-Based Explanation Agents for Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19120,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural-language explanations in recommender systems, acting as explanation agents that reason over user behavior histories. While prior work has focused on explanation fluency and relevance under fixed inputs, the robustness of LLM-generated explanations to realistic user behavior noise remains largely unexplored. In real-world web platforms, interaction histories are inherently noisy due to accidental clicks, temporal inconsistencies, missing values, and evolving preferences, raising concerns about explanation stability and user trust. We present RobustExplain, the first systematic evaluation framework for measuring the robustness of LLM-generated recommendation explanations. RobustExplain introduces five realistic user behavior perturbations evaluated across multiple severity levels and a multi-dimensional robustness metric capturing semantic, keyword, structural, and length consistency. Our goal is to establish a principled, task-level evaluation framework and initial robustness baselines, rather than to provide a comprehensive leaderboard across all available LLMs. Experiments on four representative LLMs (7B--70B) show that current models exhibit only moderate robustness, with larger models achieving up to 8% higher stability. Our results establish the first robustness benchmarks for explanation agents and highlight robustness as a critical dimension for trustworthy, agent-driven recommender systems at web scale.","Guilin Zhang, Kai Zhao, Jeffrey Friedman, Xu Chu"
LLMs as Orchestrators: Constraint-Compliant Multi-Agent Optimization for Recommendation Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19121,"Recommendation systems must optimize multiple objectives while satisfying hard business constraints such as fairness and coverage. For example, an e-commerce platform may require every recommendation list to include items from multiple sellers and at least one newly listed product; violating such constraints--even once--is unacceptable in production. Prior work on multi-objective recommendation and recent LLM-based recommender agents largely treat constraints as soft penalties or focus on item scoring and interaction, leading to frequent violations in real-world deployments. How to leverage LLMs for coordinating constrained optimization in recommendation systems remains underexplored. We propose DualAgent-Rec, an LLM-coordinated dual-agent framework for constrained multi-objective e-commerce recommendation. The framework separates optimization into an Exploitation Agent that prioritizes accuracy under hard constraints and an Exploration Agent that promotes diversity through unconstrained Pareto search. An LLM-based coordinator adaptively allocates resources between agents based on optimization progress and constraint satisfaction, while an adaptive epsilon-relaxation mechanism guarantees feasibility of final solutions. Experiments on the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset demonstrate that DualAgent-Rec achieves 100% constraint satisfaction and improves Pareto hypervolume by 4-6% over strong baselines, while maintaining competitive accuracy-diversity trade-offs. These results indicate that LLMs can act as effective orchestration agents for deployable and constraint-compliant recommendation systems.","Guilin Zhang, Kai Zhao, Jeffrey Friedman, Xu Chu"
UniRec: Unified Multimodal Encoding for LLM-Based Recommendations,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19423,"Large language models have recently shown promise for multimodal recommendation, particularly with text and image inputs. Yet real-world recommendation signals extend far beyond these modalities. To reflect this, we formalize recommendation features into four modalities: text, images, categorical features, and numerical attributes, and highlight the unique challenges this heterogeneity poses for LLMs in understanding multimodal information. In particular, these challenges arise not only across modalities but also within them, as attributes such as price, rating, and time may all be numeric yet carry distinct semantic meanings. Beyond this intra-modality ambiguity, another major challenge is the nested structure of recommendation signals, where user histories are sequences of items, each associated with multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we propose UniRec, a unified multimodal encoder for LLM-based recommendation. UniRec first employs modality-specific encoders to produce consistent embeddings across heterogeneous signals. It then adopts a triplet representation, comprising attribute name, type, and value, to separate schema from raw inputs and preserve semantic distinctions. Finally, a hierarchical Q-Former models the nested structure of user interactions while maintaining their layered organization. Across multiple real-world benchmarks, UniRec outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and LLM-based recommenders by up to 15%, and extensive ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component.","Zijie Lei, Tao Feng, Zhigang Hua, Yan Xie, Guanyu Lin, Shuang Yang, Ge Liu, Jiaxuan You"
Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19501,"Generative recommendation (GR) typically first quantizes continuous item embeddings into multi-level semantic IDs (SIDs), and then generates the next item via autoregressive decoding. Although existing methods are already competitive in terms of recommendation performance, directly inheriting the autoregressive decoding paradigm from language models still suffers from three key limitations: (1) autoregressive decoding struggles to jointly capture global dependencies among the multi-dimensional features associated with different positions of SID; (2) using a unified, fixed decoding path for the same item implicitly assumes that all users attend to item attributes in the same order; (3) autoregressive decoding is inefficient at inference time and struggles to meet real-time requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose MDGR, a Masked Diffusion Generative Recommendation framework that reshapes the GR pipeline from three perspectives: codebook, training, and inference. (1) We adopt a parallel codebook to provide a structural foundation for diffusion-based GR. (2) During training, we adaptively construct masking supervision signals along both the temporal and sample dimensions. (3) During inference, we develop a warm-up-based two-stage parallel decoding strategy for efficient generation of SIDs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and industrial-scale datasets show that MDGR outperforms ten state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.78%. Furthermore, by deploying MDGR on a large-scale online advertising platform, we achieve a 1.20% increase in revenue, demonstrating its practical value.","Lingyu Mu, Hao Deng, Haibo Xing, Jinxin Hu, Yu Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng, Jing Zhang"

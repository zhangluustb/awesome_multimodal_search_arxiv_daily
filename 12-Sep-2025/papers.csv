Vector embedding of multi-modal texts: a tool for discovery?,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08216,"Computer science texts are particularly rich in both narrative content and illustrative charts, algorithms, images, annotated diagrams, etc. This study explores the extent to which vector-based multimodal retrieval, powered by vision-language models (VLMs), can improve discovery across multi-modal (text and images) content. Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from computer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate multi-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These embeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural language queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across four similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the strengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity most effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages. We further discuss the practicality of using a vector database and multi-modal embedding for operational information retrieval. Our paper is intended to offer design insights for discovery over digital libraries.

UniSearch: Rethinking Search System with a Unified Generative Architecture,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06887,"Modern search systems play a crucial role in facilitating information acquisition. Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative search as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely end-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first and then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch, a unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces the cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search Generator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of relevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item embeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training framework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and improving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model and real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B testing in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong effectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in live search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of our product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world applications.","Jiahui Chen, Xiaoze Jiang, Zhibo Wang, Quanzhi Zhu, Junyao Zhao, Feng Hu, Kang Pan, Ao Xie, Maohua Pei, Zhiheng Qin, Hongjing Zhang, Zhixin Zhai, Xiaobo Guo, Runbin Zhou, Kefeng Wang, Mingyang Geng, Cheng Chen, Jingshan Lv, Yupeng Huang, Xiao Liang, Han Li"
Whose Name Comes Up? Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00074,"This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.","Daniele Barolo, Chiara Valentin, Fariba Karimi, Luis Gal\'arraga, Gonzalo G.

Rich-Media Re-Ranker: A User Satisfaction-Driven LLM Re-ranking Framework for Rich-Media Search,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05408,"Re-ranking plays a crucial role in modern information search systems by refining the ranking of initial search results to better satisfy user information needs. However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the proposed framework has been deployed in a large-scale industrial search system, yielding substantial improvements in online user engagement rates and satisfaction metrics.","Zihao Guo, Ligang Zhou, Zeyang Tang, Feicheng Li, Ying Nie, Zhiming Peng, Qingyun Sun, Jianxin Li"
LMMRec: LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05474,"Motivation-based recommendation systems uncover user behavior drivers. Motivation modeling, crucial for decision-making and content preference, explains recommendation generation. Existing methods often treat motivation as latent variables from interaction data, neglecting heterogeneous information like review text. In multimodal motivation fusion, two challenges arise: 1) achieving stable cross-modal alignment amid noise, and 2) identifying features reflecting the same underlying motivation across modalities. To address these, we propose LLM-driven Motivation-aware Multimodal Recommendation (LMMRec), a model-agnostic framework leveraging large language models for deep semantic priors and motivation understanding. LMMRec uses chain-of-thought prompting to extract fine-grained user and item motivations from text. A dual-encoder architecture models textual and interaction-based motivations for cross-modal alignment, while Motivation Coordination Strategy and Interaction-Text Correspondence Method mitigate noise and semantic drift through contrastive learning and momentum updates. Experiments on three datasets show LMMRec achieves up to a 4.98\% performance improvement.","Yicheng Di, Zhanjie Zhang, Yun Wangc, Jinren Liue, Jiaqi Yanf, Jiyu Wei, Xiangyu Chend, Yuan Liu"
GLASS: A Generative Recommender for Long-sequence Modeling via SID-Tier and Semantic Search,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05663,"Leveraging long-term user behavioral patterns is a key trajectory for enhancing the accuracy of modern recommender systems. While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality. Our codes are made publicly available to facilitate further research in generative recommendation.","Shiteng Cao, Junda She, Ji Liu, Bin Zeng, Chengcheng Guo, Kuo Cai, Qiang Luo, Ruiming Tang, Han Li, Kun Gai, Zhiheng Li, Cheng Yang"
AgenticTagger: Structured Item Representation for Recommendation with LLM Agents,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05945,"High-quality representations are a core requirement for effective recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation.","Zhouhang Xie, Bo Peng, Zhankui He, Ziqi Chen, Alice Han, Isabella Ye, Benjamin Coleman, Noveen Sachdeva, Fernando Pereira, Julian McAuley, Wang-Cheng Kang, Derek Zhiyuan Cheng, Beidou Wang, Randolph Brown"
"A Human-in-the-Loop, LLM-Centered Architecture for Knowledge-Graph Question Answering",https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05512,"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG.","Larissa Pusch, Alexandre Courtiol, Tim Conrad"
PASH at TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track: Generative Enhanced Model for Multi-stage Ranking,https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11245,"This paper describes the PASH participation in TREC 2021 Deep Learning Track. In the recall stage, we adopt a scheme combining sparse and dense retrieval method. In the multi-stage ranking phase, point-wise and pair-wise ranking strategies are used one after another based on model continual pre-trained on general knowledge and document-level data. Compared to TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track, we have additionally introduced the generative model T5 to further enhance the performance.","Yixuan Qiao, Shanshan Zhao, Jun Wang, Hao Chen, Tuozhen Liu, Xianbin Ye, Xin Tang, Rui Fang, Peng Gao, Wenfeng Xie, Guotong Xie"

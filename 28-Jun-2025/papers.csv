Leveraging LLM-Assisted Query Understanding for Live Retrieval-Augmented Generation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21384,"Real-world live retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges when processing user queries that are often noisy, ambiguous, and contain multiple intents. While RAG enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge, current systems typically struggle with such complex inputs, as they are often trained or evaluated on cleaner data. This paper introduces Omni-RAG, a novel framework designed to improve the robustness and effectiveness of RAG systems in live, open-domain settings. Omni-RAG employs LLM-assisted query understanding to preprocess user inputs through three key modules: (1) Deep Query Understanding and Decomposition, which utilizes LLMs with tailored prompts to denoise queries (e.g., correcting spelling errors) and decompose multi-intent queries into structured sub-queries; (2) Intent-Aware Knowledge Retrieval, which performs retrieval for each sub-query from a corpus (i.e., FineWeb using OpenSearch) and aggregates the results; and (3) Reranking and Generation, where a reranker (i.e., BGE) refines document selection before a final response is generated by an LLM (i.e., Falcon-10B) using a chain-of-thought prompt. Omni-RAG aims to bridge the gap between current RAG capabilities and the demands of real-world applications, such as those highlighted by the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, by robustly handling complex and noisy queries.","Guanting Dong, Xiaoxi Li, Yuyao Zhang, Mengjie Deng"

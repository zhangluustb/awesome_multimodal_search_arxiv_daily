"Conversational LLMs Simplify Secure Clinical Data Access, Understanding, and Analysis",https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01053,"As ever-larger clinical datasets become available, they have the potential to unlock unprecedented opportunities for medical research. Foremost among them is Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest open-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets, particularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to understand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant barrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to understanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the hosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers converse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural language; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query against the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the underlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show that minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that once demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the complexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the broader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates the translation of raw records into actionable insight.","Rafi Al Attrach, Pedro Moreira, Rajna Fani, Renato Umeton, Leo Anthony Celi"
A Data Science Approach to Calcutta High Court Judgments: An Efficient LLM and RAG-powered Framework for Summarization and Similar Cases Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01058,"The judiciary, as one of democracy's three pillars, is dealing with a rising amount of legal issues, needing careful use of judicial resources. This research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information, benefiting the overall legal scenario.","Puspendu Banerjee, Aritra Mazumdar, Wazib Ansar, Saptarsi Goswami, Amlan Chakrabarti"
Embedding-based Retrieval in Multimodal Content Moderation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01066,"Video understanding plays a fundamental role for content moderation on short video platforms, enabling the detection of inappropriate content. While classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.","Hanzhong Liang, Jinghao Shi, Xiang Shen, Zixuan Wang, Vera Wen, Ardalan Mehrani, Zhiqian Chen, Yifan Wu, Zhixin Zhang"
"Large Language Models, and LLM-Based Agents, Should Be Used to Enhance the Digital Public Sphere",https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12123,"This paper argues that large language model-based recommenders can displace today's attention-allocation machinery. LLM-based recommenders would ingest open-web content, infer a user's natural-language goals, and present information that matches their reflective preferences. Properly designed, they could deliver personalization without industrial-scale data hoarding, return control to individuals, optimize for genuine ends rather than click-through proxies, and support autonomous attention management. Synthesizing evidence of current systems' harms with recent work on LLM-driven pipelines, we identify four key research hurdles: generating candidates without centralized data, maintaining computational efficiency, modeling preferences robustly, and defending against prompt-injection. None looks prohibitive; surmounting them would steer the digital public sphere toward democratic, human-centered values.","Seth Lazar, Luke Thorburn, Tian Jin, Luca Belli"

LLMDiRec: LLM-Enhanced Intent Diffusion for Sequential Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03259,"Existing sequential recommendation models, even advanced diffusion-based approaches, often struggle to capture the rich semantic intent underlying user behavior, especially for new users or long-tail items. This limitation stems from their reliance on ID-based embeddings, which lack semantic grounding. We introduce LLMDiRec, a new approach that addresses this gap by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into an intent-aware diffusion model. Our approach combines collaborative signals from ID embeddings with rich semantic representations from LLMs, using a dynamic fusion mechanism and a multi-task objective to align both views. We run extensive experiments on five public datasets. We run extensive experiments on five public datasets. We demonstrate that \modelname outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, with particularly strong improvements in capturing complex user intents and enhancing recommendation performance for long-tail items.","Bo-Chian Chen, Manel Slokom"
Roles of MLLMs in Visually Rich Document Retrieval for RAG: A Survey,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03262,"Visually rich documents (VRDs) challenge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with layout-dependent semantics, brittle OCR, and evidence spread across complex figures and structured tables. This survey examines how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are being used to make VRD retrieval practical for RAG. We organize the literature into three roles: Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers. We compare these roles along retrieval granularity, information fidelity, latency and index size, and compatibility with reranking and grounding. We also outline key trade-offs and offer some practical guidance on when to favor each role. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including adaptive retrieval units, model size reduction, and the development of evaluation methods.",Xiantao Zhang
ALERT: Zero-shot LLM Jailbreak Detection via Internal Discrepancy Amplification,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03600,"Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.","Xiao Lin, Philip Li, Zhichen Zeng, Tingwei Li, Tianxin Wei, Xuying Ning, Gaotang Li, Yuzhong Chen, Hanghang Tong"

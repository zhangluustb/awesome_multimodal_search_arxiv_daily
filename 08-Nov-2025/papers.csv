Caption Injection for Optimization in Generative Search Engine,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04080,"Generative Search Engines (GSEs) leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate multi-source information and provide users with accurate and comprehensive responses. Unlike traditional search engines that present results in ranked lists, GSEs shift users' attention from sequential browsing to content-driven subjective perception, driving a paradigm shift in information retrieval. In this context, enhancing the subjective visibility of content through Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO) methods has emerged as a new research focus. With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques, GSEs can now efficiently integrate text, images, audio, and video, producing richer responses that better satisfy complex information needs. Existing G-SEO methods, however, remain limited to text-based optimization and fail to fully exploit multimodal data. To address this gap, we propose Caption Injection, the first multimodal G-SEO approach, which extracts captions from images and injects them into textual content, integrating visual semantics to enhance the subjective visibility of content in generative search scenarios. We systematically evaluate Caption Injection on MRAMG, a benchmark for MRAG, under both unimodal and multimodal settings. Experimental results show that Caption Injection significantly outperforms text-only G-SEO baselines under the G-Eval metric, demonstrating the necessity and effectiveness of multimodal integration in G-SEO to improve user-perceived content visibility.","Xiaolu Chen, Yong Liao"
E-CARE: An Efficient LLM-based Commonsense-Augmented Framework for E-Commerce,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04087,"Finding relevant products given a user query plays a pivotal role in an e-commerce platform, as it can spark shopping behaviors and result in revenue gains. The challenge lies in accurately predicting the correlation between queries and products. Recently, mining the cross-features between queries and products based on the commonsense reasoning capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promising performance. However, such methods suffer from high costs due to intensive real-time LLM inference during serving, as well as human annotations and potential Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). To boost efficiency while leveraging the commonsense reasoning capacity of LLMs for various e-commerce tasks, we propose the Efficient Commonsense-Augmented Recommendation Enhancer (E-CARE). During inference, models augmented with E-CARE can access commonsense reasoning with only a single LLM forward pass per query by utilizing a commonsense reasoning factor graph that encodes most of the reasoning schema from powerful LLMs. The experiments on 2 downstream tasks show an improvement of up to 12.1% on precision@5.","Ge Zhang, Rohan Deepak Ajwani, Tony Zheng, Hongjian Gu, Yaochen Hu, Wei Guo, Mark Coates, Yingxue Zhang"
LLM-as-a-Judge: Toward World Models for Slate Recommendation Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04541,"Modeling user preferences across domains remains a key challenge in slate recommendation (i.e. recommending an ordered sequence of items) research. We investigate how Large Language Models (LLM) can effectively act as world models of user preferences through pairwise reasoning over slates. We conduct an empirical study involving several LLMs on three tasks spanning different datasets. Our results reveal relationships between task performance and properties of the preference function captured by LLMs, hinting towards areas for improvement and highlighting the potential of LLMs as world models in recommender systems.","Baptiste Bonin, Maxime Heuillet, Audrey Durand"
KnowThyself: An Agentic Assistant for LLM Interpretability,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03878,"We develop KnowThyself, an agentic assistant that advances large language model (LLM) interpretability. Existing tools provide useful insights but remain fragmented and code-intensive. KnowThyself consolidates these capabilities into a chat-based interface, where users can upload models, pose natural language questions, and obtain interactive visualizations with guided explanations. At its core, an orchestrator LLM first reformulates user queries, an agent router further directs them to specialized modules, and the outputs are finally contextualized into coherent explanations. This design lowers technical barriers and provides an extensible platform for LLM inspection. By embedding the whole process into a conversational workflow, KnowThyself offers a robust foundation for accessible LLM interpretability.","Suraj Prasai, Mengnan Du, Ying Zhang, Fan Yang"
Ground-Truth Subgraphs for Better Training and Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Augmented LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04473,"Retrieval of information from graph-structured knowledge bases represents a promising direction for improving the factuality of LLMs. While various solutions have been proposed, a comparison of methods is difficult due to the lack of challenging QA datasets with ground-truth targets for graph retrieval. We present SynthKGQA, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic Knowledge Graph Question Answering datasets from any Knowledge Graph, providing the full set of ground-truth facts in the KG to reason over each question. We show how, in addition to enabling more informative benchmarking of KG retrievers, the data produced with SynthKGQA also allows us to train better models. We apply SynthKGQA to Wikidata to generate GTSQA, a new dataset designed to test zero-shot generalization abilities of KG retrievers with respect to unseen graph structures and relation types, and benchmark popular solutions for KG-augmented LLMs on it.","Alberto Cattaneo, Carlo Luschi, Daniel Justus"
RUST-BENCH: Benchmarking LLM Reasoning on Unstructured Text within Structured Tables,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04491,"Existing tabular reasoning benchmarks mostly test models on small, uniform tables, underrepresenting the complexity of real-world data and giving an incomplete view of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning abilities. Real tables are long, heterogeneous, and domain-specific, mixing structured fields with free text and requiring multi-hop reasoning across thousands of tokens. To address this gap, we introduce RUST-BENCH, a benchmark of 7966 questions from 2031 real-world tables spanning two domains: i) RB-Science (NSF grant records) and ii) RB-Sports (NBA statistics). Unlike prior work, RUST-BENCH evaluates LLMs jointly across scale, heterogeneity, domain specificity, and reasoning complexity. Experiments with open-source and proprietary models show that LLMs struggle with heterogeneous schemas and complex multi-hop inference, revealing persistent weaknesses in current architectures and prompting strategies. RUST-BENCH establishes a challenging new testbed for advancing tabular reasoning research.","Nikhil Abhyankar, Purvi Chaurasia, Sanchit Kabra, Ananya Srivastava, Vivek Gupta, Chandan K. Reddy"
DashCLIP: Leveraging multimodal models for generating semantic embeddings for DoorDash,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07110,"Despite the success of vision-language models in various generative tasks, obtaining high-quality semantic representations for products and user intents is still challenging due to the inability of off-the-shelf models to capture nuanced relationships between the entities. In this paper, we introduce a joint training framework for product and user queries by aligning uni-modal and multi-modal encoders through contrastive learning on image-text data. Our novel approach trains a query encoder with an LLM-curated relevance dataset, eliminating the reliance on engagement history. These embeddings demonstrate strong generalization capabilities and improve performance across applications, including product categorization and relevance prediction. For personalized ads recommendation, a significant uplift in the click-through rate and conversion rate after the deployment further confirms the impact on key business metrics. We believe that the flexibility of our framework makes it a promising solution toward enriching the user experience across the e-commerce landscape.","Omkar Gurjar, Kin Sum Liu, Praveen Kolli, Utsaw Kumar, Mandar Rahurkar"

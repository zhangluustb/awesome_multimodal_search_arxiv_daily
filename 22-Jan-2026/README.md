| IF-GEO: Conflict-Aware Instruction Fusion for Multi-Query Generative Engine Optimization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13938](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13938) | As Generative Engines revolutionize information retrieval by synthesizing direct answers from retrieved sources, ensuring source visibility becomes a significant challenge. Improving it through targeted content revisions is a practical strategy termed Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). However, optimizing a document for diverse queries presents a constrained optimization challenge where heterogeneous queries often impose conflicting and competing revision requirements under a limited content budget. To address this challenge, we propose IF-GEO, a "diverge-then-converge" framework comprising two phases: (i) mining distinct optimization preferences from representative latent queries; (ii) synthesizing a Global Revision Blueprint for guided editing by coordinating preferences via conflict-aware instruction fusion. To explicitly quantify IF-GEO's objective of cross-query stability, we introduce risk-aware stability metrics. Experiments on multi-query benchmarks demonstrate that IF-GEO achieves substantial performance gains while maintaining robustness across diverse retrieval scenarios. | Heyang Zhou (School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China), JiaJia Chen (Institute of Dataspace, Hefei Comprehensive National Science Center), Xiaolu Chen (School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China), Jie Bao (School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China), Zhen Chen (School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China), Yong Liao (School of Cyber Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China) |
| Don't Start Over: A Cost-Effective Framework for Migrating Personalized Prompts Between LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12034) | Personalization in Large Language Models (LLMs) often relies on user-specific soft prompts. However, these prompts become obsolete when the foundation model is upgraded, necessitating costly, full-scale retraining. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Prompt-level User Migration Adapter (PUMA), a lightweight framework to efficiently migrate personalized prompts across incompatible models. PUMA utilizes a parameter-efficient adapter to bridge the semantic gap, combined with a group-based user selection strategy to significantly reduce training costs. Experiments on three large-scale datasets show our method matches or even surpasses the performance of retraining from scratch, reducing computational cost by up to 98%. The framework demonstrates strong generalization across diverse model architectures and robustness in advanced scenarios like chained and aggregated migrations, offering a practical path for the sustainable evolution of personalized AI by decoupling user assets from the underlying models. | Ziyi Zhao, Chongming Gao, Yang Zhang, Haoyan Liu, Weinan Gan, Huifeng Guo, Yong Liu, Fuli Feng |
| Optimizing User Profiles via Contextual Bandits for Retrieval-Augmented LLM Personalization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12078](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12078) | Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general-purpose tasks, yet adapting their responses to individual users remains challenging. Retrieval augmentation provides a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning by conditioning LLMs on user history records, and existing approaches typically select these records based on semantic relevance. We argue that relevance serves as an unreliable proxy for utility: a record may be semantically similar to a query yet fail to improve generation quality or even degrade it due to redundancy or conflicting information. To bridge this gap, we propose PURPLE, a contextual bandit framework that oPtimizes UseR Profiles for Llm pErsonalization. In contrast to a greedy selection of the most relevant records, PURPLE treats profile construction as a set generation process and utilizes a Plackett-Luce ranking model to capture complex inter-record dependencies. By training with dense feedback provided by the likelihood of the reference response, our method aligns retrieval directly with generation quality. Extensive experiments on nine personalization tasks demonstrate that PURPLE consistently outperforms strong heuristic and retrieval-augmented baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, establishing a principled and scalable solution for optimizing user profiles. | Linfeng Du, Ye Yuan, Zichen Zhao, Fuyuan Lyu, Emiliano Penaloza, Xiuying Chen, Zipeng Sun, Jikun Kang, Laurent Charlin, Xue Liu, Haolun Wu |
| LLM-based relevance assessment still can't replace human relevance assessment | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17156](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17156) | The use of large language models (LLMs) for relevance assessment in information retrieval has gained significant attention, with recent studies suggesting that LLM-based judgments provide comparable evaluations to human judgments. Notably, based on TREC 2024 data, Upadhyay et al make a bold claim that LLM-based relevance assessments, such as those generated by the Umbrela system, can fully replace traditional human relevance assessments in TREC-style evaluations. This paper critically examines this claim, highlighting practical and theoretical limitations that undermine the validity of this conclusion.
  First, we question whether the evidence provided by Upadhyay et al. genuinely supports their claim, particularly when the test collection is intended to serve as a benchmark for future research innovations.Second, we submit a system deliberately crafted to exploit automatic evaluation metrics, demonstrating that it can achieve artificially inflated scores without truly improving retrieval quality. Third, we simulate the consequences of circularity by analyzing Kendall's tau correlations under the hypothetical scenario in which all systems adopt Umbrela as a final-stage re-ranker, illustrating how reliance on LLM-based assessments can distort system rankings. Theoretical challenges - including the inherent narcissism of LLMs, the risk of overfitting to LLM-based metrics, and the potential degradation of future LLM performance - that must be addressed before LLM-based relevance assessments can be considered a viable replacement for human judgments. | Charles L.

| Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645) | Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However, existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module, calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. | Hongyang Liu, Zhu Sun, Tianjun Wei, Yan Wang, Jiajie Zhu, Xinghua Qu |
| Efficient Optimization of Hierarchical Identifiers for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18434](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18434) | SEATER is a generative retrieval model that improves recommendation inference efficiency and retrieval quality by utilizing balanced tree-structured item identifiers and contrastive training objectives. We reproduce and validate SEATER's reported improvements in retrieval quality over strong baselines across all datasets from the original work, and extend the evaluation to Yambda, a large-scale music recommendation dataset. Our experiments verify SEATER's strong performance, but show that its tree construction step during training becomes a major bottleneck as the number of items grows. To address this, we implement and evaluate two alternative construction algorithms: a greedy method optimized for minimal build time, and a hybrid method that combines greedy clustering at high levels with more precise grouping at lower levels. The greedy method reduces tree construction time to less than 2% of the original with only a minor drop in quality on the dataset with the largest item collection. The hybrid method achieves retrieval quality on par with the original, and even improves on the largest dataset, while cutting construction time to just 5-8%.

| OpenNovelty: An LLM-powered Agentic System for Verifiable Scholarly Novelty Assessment | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01576](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01576) | Evaluating novelty is critical yet challenging in peer review, as reviewers must assess submissions against a vast, rapidly evolving literature. This report presents OpenNovelty, an LLM-powered agentic system for transparent, evidence-based novelty analysis. The system operates through four phases: (1) extracting the core task and contribution claims to generate retrieval queries; (2) retrieving relevant prior work based on extracted queries via semantic search engine; (3) constructing a hierarchical taxonomy of core-task-related work and performing contribution-level full-text comparisons against each contribution; and (4) synthesizing all analyses into a structured novelty report with explicit citations and evidence snippets. Unlike naive LLM-based approaches, \textsc{OpenNovelty} grounds all assessments in retrieved real papers, ensuring verifiable judgments. We deploy our system on 500+ ICLR 2026 submissions with all reports publicly available on our website, and preliminary analysis suggests it can identify relevant prior work, including closely related papers that authors may overlook. OpenNovelty aims to empower the research community with a scalable tool that promotes fair, consistent, and evidence-backed peer review. | Ming Zhang, Kexin Tan, Yueyuan Huang, Yujiong Shen, Chunchun Ma, Li Ju, Xinran Zhang, Yuhui Wang, Wenqing Jing, Jingyi Deng, Huayu Sha, Binze Hu, Jingqi Tong, Changhao Jiang, Yage Geng, Yuankai Ying, Yue Zhang, Zhangyue Yin, Zhiheng Xi, Shihan Dou, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang |
| LLMs Meet Isolation Kernel: Lightweight, Learning-free Binary Embeddings for Fast Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09159) | Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled remarkable progress in text representation. However, their embeddings are typically high-dimensional, leading to substantial storage and retrieval overhead. Although recent approaches such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) alleviate these issues to some extent, they still suffer from retrieval accuracy degradation. This paper proposes \emph{Isolation Kernel Embedding} or IKE, a learning-free method that transforms an LLM embedding into a binary embedding using Isolation Kernel (IK). IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows. Lightweight and based on binary encoding, it offers low memory footprint and fast bitwise computation, lowering retrieval latency. Experiments on multiple text retrieval datasets demonstrate that IKE offers up to 16.7x faster retrieval and 16x lower memory usage than LLM embeddings, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. Compared to CSR and other compression methods, IKE consistently achieves the best balance between retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. | Zhibo Zhang, Yang Xu, Kai Ming Ting, Cam-Tu Nguyen |
| Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478) | Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

| PersonalAI: A Systematic Comparison of Knowledge Graph Storage and Retrieval Approaches for Personalized LLM agents | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17001](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17001) | Personalizing language models that effectively incorporating user interaction history remains a central challenge in development of adaptive AI systems. While large language models (LLMs), combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graph, which construct and update memory model automatically by LLM itself. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyper-edges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle traversal, beam search and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks: TriviaQA, HotpotQA, DiaASQ and demonstrate that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning. | Mikhail Menschikov, Dmitry Evseev, Victoria Dochkina, Ruslan Kostoev, Ilia Perepechkin, Petr Anokhin, Evgeny Burnaev, Nikita Semenov |
| Multi-Stage Verification-Centric Framework for Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-Modal RAG | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20136) | This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn (CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

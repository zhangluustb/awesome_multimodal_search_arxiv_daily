Multimodal-enhanced Federated Recommendation: A Group-wise Fusion Approach,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19955,"Federated Recommendation (FR) is a new learning paradigm to tackle the learn-to-rank problem in a privacy-preservation manner. How to integrate multi-modality features into federated recommendation is still an open challenge in terms of efficiency, distribution heterogeneity, and fine-grained alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal fusion mechanism in federated recommendation settings (GFMFR). Specifically, it offloads multimodal representation learning to the server, which stores item content and employs a high-capacity encoder to generate expressive representations, alleviating client-side overhead. Moreover, a group-aware item representation fusion approach enables fine-grained knowledge sharing among similar users while retaining individual preferences. The proposed fusion loss could be simply plugged into any existing federated recommender systems empowering their capability by adding multi-modality features. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that GFMFR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal FR baselines.","Chunxu Zhang, Weipeng Zhang, Guodong Long, Zhiheng Xue, Riting Xia, Bo Yang"
Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck for Multimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20225,"Multimodal data has significantly advanced recommendation systems by integrating diverse information sources to model user preferences and item characteristics. However, these systems often struggle with redundant and irrelevant information, which can degrade performance. Most existing methods either fuse multimodal information directly or use rigid architectural separation for disentanglement, failing to adequately filter noise and model the complex interplay between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Representation-disentangled Information Bottleneck (MRdIB). Concretely, we first employ a Multimodal Information Bottleneck to compress the input representations, effectively filtering out task-irrelevant noise while preserving rich semantic information. Then, we decompose the information based on its relationship with the recommendation target into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. We achieve this decomposition with a series of constraints: a unique information learning objective to preserve modality-unique signals, a redundant information learning objective to minimize overlap, and a synergistic information learning objective to capture emergent information. By optimizing these objectives, MRdIB guides a model to learn more powerful and disentangled representations. Extensive experiments on several competitive models and three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our MRdIB in enhancing multimodal recommendation.","Hui Wang, Jinghui Qin, Wushao Wen, Qingling Li, Shanshan Zhong, Zhongzhan Huang"
SAFE: Improving LLM Systems using Sentence-Level In-generation Attribution,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12621,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in various science domains, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by a critical challenge: the lack of trustworthy, verifiable outputs. Current LLMs often generate answers without reliable source attribution, or worse, with incorrect attributions, posing a barrier to their use in scientific and high-stakes settings, where traceability and accountability are paramount. To be reliable, attribution systems require high accuracy for short-length attribution on retrieved data, i.e., attribution to a sentence within a document rather than the entire document. We propose SAFE, a Sentence-level A ttribution FramEwork for Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that attributes generated sentences during generation. This allows users to verify sentences as they read them and correct the model when the attribution indicates the generated text is not grounded in the documents, increasing the safety of LLM systems. This framework consists of two steps: predicting the required number of references for a sentence, and attributing the sentence. Our approach achieved 95% accuracy in the first step, which translated to 2.1\~6.0% improvements in the accuracy (normalized for maximum possible accuracy) of all attribution algorithms in our clean dataset, when compared to their top-1 accuracy. We also applied SAFE in real-world scenarios with documents containing hundreds to thousands of sentences. In these settings, SAFE reliably attributed sentences to their source documents, demonstrating that the method generalizes beyond controlled benchmarks. The SAFE framework and the training dataset are publicly available on GitHub.","Jo\~ao Eduardo Batista, Emil Vatai, Mohamed Wahib"
Weaver: Interweaving SQL and LLM for Table Reasoning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18961,"Querying tables with unstructured data is challenging due to the presence of text (or image), either embedded in the table or in external paragraphs, which traditional SQL struggles to process, especially for tasks requiring semantic reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context, they face limitations with long input sequences. Existing approaches that combine SQL and LLMs typically rely on rigid, predefined work-flows, limiting their adaptability to complex queries. To address these issues, we introduce Weaver , a modular pipeline that dynamically integrates SQL and LLMs for table-based question answering (TableQA). Weaver generates a flexible, step-by-step plan that combines SQL for structured data retrieval with LLMs for semantic processing. By decomposing complex queries into manageable subtasks, Weaver improves accuracy and generalization. Our experiments show that Weaver consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four TableQA datasets, reducing both API calls and error rates. The code, along with other associated scripts, are available at https://coral-lab-asu.github.io/weaver.","Rohit Khoja, Devanshu Gupta, Yanjie Fu, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta"

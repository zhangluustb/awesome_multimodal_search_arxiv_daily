Generative Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12871,"Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios. Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task. Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training. Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline methods.","Jinqiu Jin, Yang Zhang, Junwei Pan, Fuli Feng, Hua Lu, Haijie Gu, Xiangnan He"
SemCSE: Semantic Contrastive Sentence Embeddings Using LLM-Generated Summaries For Scientific Abstracts,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13105,"We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity. To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts, demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the benefits of a semantically focused training approach.","Marc Brinner, Sina Zarriess"
Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255,"Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.","Lyucheng Wu, Mengru Wang, Ziwen Xu, Tri Cao, Nay Oo, Bryan Hooi, Shumin Deng"
LLM-RecG: A Semantic Bias-Aware Framework for Zero-Shot Sequential Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19232,"Zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation (ZCDSR) enables predictions in unseen domains without additional training or fine-tuning, addressing the limitations of traditional models in sparse data environments. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced ZCDSR by facilitating cross-domain knowledge transfer through rich, pretrained representations. Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from differences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a persistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced generalization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic bias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across domains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics of each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that item embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without collapsing into overly generic or uniform representations. At the sequential level, we develop a method to transfer user behavioral patterns by clustering source domain user sequences and applying attention-based aggregation during target domain inference. We dynamically adapt user embeddings to unseen domains, enabling effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring target-domain interactions...","Yunzhe Li, Junting Wang, Hari Sundaram, Zhining Liu"
LLM-Driven Dual-Level Multi-Interest Modeling for Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10917,"Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests based on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same interest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with real-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant potential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the granularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to overly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis provides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more effective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to flexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters, indicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic generation of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users' collaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions, allowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's behaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived from individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose aggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more comprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering problem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users' behaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven multi-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests. Experiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.","Ziyan Wang, Yingpeng Du, Zhu Sun, Jieyi Bi, Haoyan Chua, Tianjun Wei, Jie Zhang"
LLM-Enhanced User-Item Interactions: Leveraging Edge Information for Optimized Recommendations,https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09617,"Graph recommendation methods, representing a connected interaction perspective, reformulate user-item interactions as graphs to leverage graph structure and topology to recommend and have proved practical effectiveness at scale. Large language models, representing a textual generative perspective, excel at modeling user languages, understanding behavioral contexts, capturing user-item semantic relationships, analyzing textual sentiments, and generating coherent and contextually relevant texts as recommendations. However, there is a gap between the connected graph perspective and the text generation perspective as the task formulations are different. A research question arises: how can we effectively integrate the two perspectives for more personalized recsys? To fill this gap, we propose to incorporate graph-edge information into LLMs via prompt and attention innovations. We reformulate recommendations as a probabilistic generative problem using prompts. We develop a framework to incorporate graph edge information from the prompt and attention mechanisms for graph-structured LLM recommendations. We develop a new prompt design that brings in both first-order and second-order graph relationships; we devise an improved LLM attention mechanism to embed direct the spatial and connectivity information of edges. Our evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to understand connectivity information in graph data and to improve the relevance and quality of recommendation results.","Xinyuan Wang, Liang Wu, Liangjie Hong, Hao Liu, Yanjie Fu"

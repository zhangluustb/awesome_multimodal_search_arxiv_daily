| Effectiveness of LLMs in Temporal User Profiling for Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00176](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00176) | Effectively modeling the dynamic nature of user preferences is crucial for enhancing recommendation accuracy and fostering transparency in recommender systems. Traditional user profiling often overlooks the distinction between transitory short-term interests and stable long-term preferences. This paper examines the capability of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture these temporal dynamics, generating richer user representations through distinct short-term and long-term textual summaries of interaction histories. Our observations suggest that while LLMs tend to improve recommendation quality in domains with more active user engagement, their benefits appear less pronounced in sparser environments. This disparity likely stems from the varying distinguishability of short-term and long-term preferences across domains; the approach shows greater utility where these temporal interests are more clearly separable (e.g., Movies\&amp;TV) compared to domains with more stable user profiles (e.g., Video Games). This highlights a critical trade-off between enhanced performance and computational costs, suggesting context-dependent LLM application. Beyond predictive capability, this LLM-driven approach inherently provides an intrinsic potential for interpretability through its natural language profiles and attention weights. This work contributes insights into the practical capability and inherent interpretability of LLM-driven temporal user profiling, outlining new research directions for developing adaptive and transparent recommender systems. | Milad Sabouri, Masoud Mansoury, Kun Lin, Bamshad Mobasher |
| Structurally Refined Graph Transformer for Multimodal Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00584](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00584) | Multimodal recommendation systems utilize various types of information, including images and text, to enhance the effectiveness of recommendations. The key challenge is predicting user purchasing behavior from the available data. Current recommendation models prioritize extracting multimodal information while neglecting the distinction between redundant and valuable data. They also rely heavily on a single semantic framework (e.g., local or global semantics), resulting in an incomplete or biased representation of user preferences, particularly those less expressed in prior interactions. Furthermore, these approaches fail to capture the complex interactions between users and items, limiting the model's ability to meet diverse users. To address these challenges, we present SRGFormer, a structurally optimized multimodal recommendation model. By modifying the transformer for better integration into our model, we capture the overall behavior patterns of users. Then, we enhance structural information by embedding multimodal information into a hypergraph structure to aid in learning the local structures between users and items. Meanwhile, applying self-supervised tasks to user-item collaborative signals enhances the integration of multimodal information, thereby revealing the representational features inherent to the data's modality. Extensive experiments on three public datasets reveal that SRGFormer surpasses previous benchmark models, achieving an average performance improvement of 4.47 percent on the Sports dataset. The code is publicly available online. | Ke Shi, Yan Zhang, Miao Zhang, Lifan Chen, Jiali Yi, Kui Xiao, Xiaoju Hou, Zhifei Li |
| Contextual Relevance and Adaptive Sampling for LLM-Based Document Reranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01208) | Reranking algorithms have made progress in improving document retrieval quality by efficiently aggregating relevance judgments generated by large language models (LLMs). However, identifying relevant documents for queries that require in-depth reasoning remains a major challenge. Reasoning-intensive queries often exhibit multifaceted information needs and nuanced interpretations, rendering document relevance inherently context dependent. To address this, we propose contextual relevance, which we define as the probability that a document is relevant to a given query, marginalized over the distribution of different reranking contexts it may appear in (i.e., the set of candidate documents it is ranked alongside and the order in which the documents are presented to a reranking model). While prior works have studied methods to mitigate the positional bias LLMs exhibit by accounting for the ordering of documents, we empirically find that the compositions of these batches also plays an important role in reranking performance. To efficiently estimate contextual relevance, we propose TS-SetRank, a sampling-based, uncertainty-aware reranking algorithm. Empirically, TS-SetRank improves nDCG@10 over retrieval and reranking baselines by 15-25% on BRIGHT and 6-21% on BEIR, highlighting the importance of modeling relevance as context-dependent. | Jerry Huang, Siddarth Madala, Cheng Niu, Julia Hockenmaier, Tong Zhang |
| CAT-ID$^2$: Category-Tree Integrated Document Identifier Learning for Generative Retrieval In E-commerce | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01461) | Generative retrieval (GR) has gained significant attention as an effective paradigm that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It generally consists of two stages: constructing discrete semantic identifiers (IDs) for documents and retrieving documents by autoregressively generating ID tokens. The core challenge in GR is how to construct document IDs (DocIDS) with strong representational power. Good IDs should exhibit two key properties: similar documents should have more similar IDs, and each document should maintain a distinct and unique ID. However, most existing methods ignore native category information, which is common and critical in E-commerce. Therefore, we propose a novel ID learning method, CAtegory-Tree Integrated Document IDentifier (CAT-ID$^2$), incorporating prior category information into the semantic IDs. CAT-ID$^2$ includes three key modules: a Hierarchical Class Constraint Loss to integrate category information layer by layer during quantization, a Cluster Scale Constraint Loss for uniform ID token distribution, and a Dispersion Loss to improve the distinction of reconstructed documents. These components enable CAT-ID$^2$ to generate IDs that make similar documents more alike while preserving the uniqueness of different documents' representations. Extensive offline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method, with online A/B tests showing a 0.33% increase in average orders per thousand users for ambiguous intent queries and 0.24% for long-tail queries. | Xiaoyu Liu, Fuwei Zhang, Yiqing Wu, Xinyu Jia, Zenghua Xia, Fuzhen Zhuang, Zhao Zhang, Fei Jiang, Wei Lin |
| PolyRecommender: A Multimodal Recommendation System for Polymer Discovery | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00375](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00375) | We introduce PolyRecommender, a multimodal discovery framework that integrates chemical language representations from PolyBERT with molecular graph-based representations from a graph encoder. The system first retrieves candidate polymers using language-based similarity and then ranks them using fused multimodal embeddings according to multiple target properties. By leveraging the complementary knowledge encoded in both modalities, PolyRecommender enables efficient retrieval and robust ranking across related polymer properties. Our work establishes a generalizable multimodal paradigm, advancing AI-guided design for the discovery of next-generation polymers. | Xin Wang, Yunhao Xiao, Rui Qiao |
| Memory Assisted LLM for Personalized Recommendation System | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03824](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03824) | Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in solving recommendation tasks. With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we define a new task that enables testing with varying memory size under two scenarios: single domain where memory and tasks are from the same category and cross-domain (e.g. memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests. | Jiarui Chen |
| Enhancing Time Awareness in Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13957](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13957) | Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm that formulates the recommendations into a text-to-text generation task, harnessing the vast knowledge of large language models. However, existing studies focus on considering the sequential order of items and neglect to handle the temporal dynamics across items, which can imply evolving user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time awareness (GRUT), effectively capturing hidden user preferences via various temporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two key contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal patterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition context provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware Inference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend information about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to 15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets.

| MLLM-Driven Semantic Identifier Generation for Generative Cross-Modal Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17359](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17359) | Generative cross-modal retrieval, which treats retrieval as a generation task, has emerged as a promising direction with the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). In this setting, the model responds to a text query by generating an identifier corresponding to the target image. However, existing methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels, or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations, we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs. These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training. | Tianyuan Li, Lei Wang, Ahtamjan Ahmat, Yating Yang, Bo Ma, Rui Dong, Bangju Han |
| Multimodal Item Scoring for Natural Language Recommendation via Gaussian Process Regression with LLM Relevance Judgments | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22023) | Natural Language Recommendation (NLRec) generates item suggestions based on the relevance between user-issued NL requests and NL item description passages. Existing NLRec approaches often use Dense Retrieval (DR) to compute item relevance scores from aggregation of inner products between user request embeddings and relevant passage embeddings. However, DR views the request as the sole relevance label, thus leading to a unimodal scoring function centered on the query embedding that is often a weak proxy for query relevance. To better capture the potential multimodal distribution of the relevance scoring function that may arise from complex NLRec data, we propose GPR-LLM that uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with LLM relevance judgments for a subset of candidate passages. Experiments on four NLRec datasets and two LLM backbones demonstrate that GPR-LLM with an RBF kernel, capable of modeling multimodal relevance scoring functions, consistently outperforms simpler unimodal kernels (dot product, cosine similarity), as well as baseline methods including DR, cross-encoder, and pointwise LLM-based relevance scoring by up to 65%. Overall, GPR-LLM provides an efficient and effective approach to NLRec within a minimal LLM labeling budget. | Yifan Liu, Qianfeng Wen, Jiazhou Liang, Mark Zhao, Justin Cui, Anton Korikov, Armin Toroghi, Junyoung Kim, Scott Sanner |
| LoVR: A Benchmark for Long Video Retrieval in Multimodal Contexts | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13928](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13928) | Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing valuable insights for future research.

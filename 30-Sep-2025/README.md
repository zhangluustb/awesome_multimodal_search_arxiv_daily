| Does Generative Retrieval Overcome the Limitations of Dense Retrieval? | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22116](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22116) | Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in neural information retrieval, offering an alternative to dense retrieval (DR) by directly generating identifiers of relevant documents. In this paper, we theoretically and empirically investigate how GR fundamentally diverges from DR in both learning objectives and representational capacity. GR performs globally normalized maximum-likelihood optimization and encodes corpus and relevance information directly in the model parameters, whereas DR adopts locally normalized objectives and represents the corpus with external embeddings before computing similarity via a bilinear interaction. Our analysis suggests that, under scaling, GR can overcome the inherent limitations of DR, yielding two major benefits. First, with larger corpora, GR avoids the sharp performance degradation caused by the optimization drift induced by DR's local normalization. Second, with larger models, GR's representational capacity scales with parameter size, unconstrained by the global low-rank structure that limits DR. We validate these theoretical insights through controlled experiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, across varying negative sampling strategies, embedding dimensions, and model scales. But despite its theoretical advantages, GR does not universally outperform DR in practice. We outline directions to bridge the gap between GR's theoretical potential and practical performance, providing guidance for future research in scalable and robust generative retrieval. | Yingchen Zhang, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten de Rijke, Yixing Fan, Xueqi Cheng |
| FORGE: Forming Semantic Identifiers for Generative Retrieval in Industrial Datasets | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20904](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20904) | Semantic identifiers (SIDs) have gained increasing attention in generative retrieval (GR) due to their meaningful semantic discriminability. However, current research on SIDs faces three main challenges: (1) the absence of large-scale public datasets with multimodal features, (2) limited investigation into optimization strategies for SID generation, which typically rely on costly GR training for evaluation, and (3) slow online convergence in industrial deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FORGE, a comprehensive benchmark for FOrming semantic identifieR in Generative rEtrieval with industrial datasets. Specifically, FORGE is equipped with a dataset comprising 14 billion user interactions and multimodal features of 250 million items sampled from Taobao, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in China. Leveraging this dataset, FORGE explores several optimizations to enhance the SID construction and validates their effectiveness via offline experiments across different settings and tasks. Further online analysis conducted on the "Guess You Like" section of Taobao's homepage shows a 0.35% increase in transaction count, highlighting the practical impact of our method. Regarding the expensive SID validation accompanied by the full training of GRs, we propose two novel metrics of SID that correlate positively with recommendation performance, enabling convenient evaluations without any GR training. For real-world applications, FORGE introduces an offline pretraining schema that reduces online convergence by half.

| IntSR: An Integrated Generative Framework for Search and Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21179) | Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications. However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&amp;R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&amp;R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&amp;R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+9.34%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+7.04%). | Huimin Yan, Longfei Xu, Junjie Sun, Ni Ou, Wei Luo, Xing Tan, Ran Cheng, Kaikui Liu, Xiangxiang Chu |

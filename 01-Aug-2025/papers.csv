"Not Just What, But When: Integrating Irregular Intervals to LLM for Sequential Recommendation",https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23209,"Time intervals between purchasing items are a crucial factor in sequential recommendation tasks, whereas existing approaches focus on item sequences and often overlook by assuming the intervals between items are static. However, dynamic intervals serve as a dimension that describes user profiling on not only the history within a user but also different users with the same item history. In this work, we propose IntervalLLM, a novel framework that integrates interval information into LLM and incorporates the novel interval-infused attention to jointly consider information of items and intervals. Furthermore, unlike prior studies that address the cold-start scenario only from the perspectives of users and items, we introduce a new viewpoint: the interval perspective to serve as an additional metric for evaluating recommendation methods on the warm and cold scenarios. Extensive experiments on 3 benchmarks with both traditional- and LLM-based baselines demonstrate that our IntervalLLM achieves not only 4.4% improvements in average but also the best-performing warm and cold scenarios across all users, items, and the proposed interval perspectives. In addition, we observe that the cold scenario from the interval perspective experiences the most significant performance drop among all recommendation methods. This finding underscores the necessity of further research on interval-based cold challenges and our integration of interval information in the realm of sequential recommendation tasks.

Towards LLM-Enhanced Product Line Scoping,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23410,"The idea of product line scoping is to identify the set of features and configurations that a product line should include, i.e., offer for configuration purposes. In this context, a major scoping task is to find a balance between commercial relevance and technical feasibility. Traditional product line scoping approaches rely on formal feature models and require a manual analysis which can be quite time-consuming. In this paper, we sketch how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be applied to support product line scoping tasks with a natural language interaction based scoping process. Using a working example from the smarthome domain, we sketch how LLMs can be applied to evaluate different feature model alternatives. We discuss open research challenges regarding the integration of LLMs with product line scoping.","Alexander Felfernig, Damian Garber, Viet-Man Le, Sebastian Lubos, Thi Ngoc Trang Tran"

| ReaKase-8B: Legal Case Retrieval via Knowledge and Reasoning Representations with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26178](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26178) | Legal case retrieval (LCR) is a cornerstone of real-world legal decision making, as it enables practitioners to identify precedents for a given query case. Existing approaches mainly rely on traditional lexical models and pretrained language models to encode the texts of legal cases. Yet there are rich information in the relations among different legal entities as well as the crucial reasoning process that uncovers how legal facts and legal issues can lead to judicial decisions. Such relational reasoning process reflects the distinctive characteristics of each case that can distinguish one from another, mirroring the real-world judicial process. Naturally, incorporating such information into the precise case embedding could further enhance the accuracy of case retrieval. In this paper, a novel ReaKase-8B framework is proposed to leverage extracted legal facts, legal issues, legal relation triplets and legal reasoning for effective legal case retrieval. ReaKase-8B designs an in-context legal case representation learning paradigm with a fine-tuned large language model. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023 demonstrate that our knowledge and reasoning augmented embeddings substantially improve retrieval performance over baseline models, highlighting the potential of integrating legal reasoning into legal case retrieval systems.

| WeaveRec: An LLM-Based Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation Framework with Model Merging | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26546) | Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) seeks to improve user preference modeling by transferring knowledge from multiple domains. Despite the progress made in CDSR, most existing methods rely on overlapping users or items to establish cross-domain correlations-a requirement that rarely holds in real-world settings. The advent of large language models (LLM) and model-merging techniques appears to overcome this limitation by unifying multi-domain data without explicit overlaps. Yet, our empirical study shows that naively training an LLM on combined domains-or simply merging several domain-specific LLMs-often degrades performance relative to a model trained solely on the target domain. To address these challenges, we first experimentally investigate the cause of suboptimal performance in LLM-based cross-domain recommendation and model merging. Building on these insights, we introduce WeaveRec, which cross-trains multiple LoRA modules with source and target domain data in a weaving fashion, and fuses them via model merging. WeaveRec can be extended to multi-source domain scenarios and notably does not introduce additional inference-time cost in terms of latency or memory. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that WeaveRec can reduce the upper bound of the expected error in the target domain. Extensive experiments on single-source, multi-source, and cross-platform cross-domain recommendation scenarios validate that WeaveRec effectively mitigates performance degradation and consistently outperforms baseline approaches in real-world recommendation tasks. | Min Hou, Xin Liu, Le Wu, Chenyi He, Hao Liu, Zhi Li, Xin Li, Si Wei |
| GraphCompliance: Aligning Policy and Context Graphs for LLM-Based Regulatory Compliance | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26309](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26309) | Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks, GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning. | Jiseong Chung, Ronny Ko, Wonchul Yoo, Makoto Onizuka, Sungmok Kim, Tae-Wan Kim, Won-Yong Shin |
| LINK-KG: LLM-Driven Coreference-Resolved Knowledge Graphs for Human Smuggling Networks | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26486](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26486) | Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans, leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks. | Dipak Meher, Carlotta Domeniconi, Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera |
| RecCocktail: A Generalizable and Efficient Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08271](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08271) | Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in recent years, owing to their impressive generalization capabilities and rich world knowledge. To capitalize on the potential of using LLMs as recommender systems, mainstream approaches typically focus on two paradigms. The first paradigm designs multi-domain or multi-task instruction data for generalizable recommendation, so as to align LLMs with general recommendation areas and deal with cold-start recommendation. The second paradigm focuses on enhancing domain-specific recommendation tasks, improving performance in warm recommendation scenarios. While most previous works treat these two paradigms separately, we argue that they have complementary advantages, and combining them can yield better results. In this paper, we propose a generalizable and efficient LLM-based recommendation framework RecCocktail. Our approach begins with fine-tuning a "base spirit" LoRA module using domain-general recommendation instruction data to align LLM with recommendation knowledge. Next, given users' behavior of a specific domain, we construct a domain-specific "ingredient" LoRA module. We then provide an entropy-guided adaptive merging method to mix the "base spirit" and the "ingredient" in the weight space. Please note that, RecCocktail combines the advantages of the existing two paradigms without introducing additional time or space overhead during the inference phase. Moreover, RecCocktail is efficient with plug and play, as the "base spirit" LoRA is trained only once, and any domain-specific "ingredient" can be efficiently mixed with only domain-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under both warm and cold-start recommendation scenarios validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed RecCocktail. | Min Hou, Chenxi Bai, Le Wu, Hao Liu, Kai Zhang, Weiwen Liu, Richang Hong, Ruiming Tang, Meng Wang |
| Decoupled Multimodal Fusion for User Interest Modeling in Click-Through Rate Prediction | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11066](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11066) | Modern industrial recommendation systems improve recommendation performance by integrating multimodal representations from pre-trained models into ID-based Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction frameworks. However, existing approaches typically adopt modality-centric modeling strategies that process ID-based and multimodal embeddings independently, failing to capture fine-grained interactions between content semantics and behavioral signals. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Multimodal Fusion (DMF), which introduces a modality-enriched modeling strategy to enable fine-grained interactions between ID-based collaborative representations and multimodal representations for user interest modeling. Specifically, we construct target-aware features to bridge the semantic gap across different embedding spaces and leverage them as side information to enhance the effectiveness of user interest modeling. Furthermore, we design an inference-optimized attention mechanism that decouples the computation of target-aware features and ID-based embeddings before the attention layer, thereby alleviating the computational bottleneck introduced by incorporating target-aware features. To achieve comprehensive multimodal integration, DMF combines user interest representations learned under the modality-centric and modality-enriched modeling strategies. Offline experiments on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DMF. Moreover, DMF has been deployed on the product recommendation system of the international e-commerce platform Lazada, achieving relative improvements of 5.30% in CTCVR and 7.43% in GMV with negligible computational overhead. | Alin Fan, Hanqing Li, Sihan Lu, Jingsong Yuan, Jiandong Zhang |
| Towards Automated Quality Assurance of Patent Specifications: A Multi-Dimensional LLM Framework | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25402](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25402) | Although AI drafting tools have gained prominence in patent writing, the systematic evaluation of AI-generated patent content quality represents a significant research gap. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module. The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80 human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools. Evaluation is performed on 10,841 total sentences, 8,924 non-template sentences, and 554 patent figures for the three detection modules respectively, achieving balanced accuracies of 99.74%, 82.12%, and 91.2% against expert annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references. | Yuqian Chai, Chaochao Wang, Weilei Wang |
| Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205) | Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data. | Ali Vosoughi, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper |

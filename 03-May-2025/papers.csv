Leveraging LLMs for Influence Path Planning in Proactive Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04827,"Recommender systems are pivotal in Internet social platforms, yet they often cater to users' historical interests, leading to critical issues like echo chambers. To broaden user horizons, proactive recommender systems aim to guide user interest to gradually like a target item beyond historical interests through an influence path,i.e., a sequence of recommended items. As a representative, Influential Recommender System (IRS) designs a sequential model for influence path planning but faces issues of lacking target item inclusion and path coherence. To address the issues, we leverage the advanced planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose an LLM-based Influence Path Planning (LLM-IPP) method. LLM-IPP generates coherent and effective influence paths by capturing user interest shifts and item characteristics. We introduce novel evaluation metrics and user simulators to benchmark LLM-IPP against traditional methods. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM-IPP significantly enhances user acceptability and path coherence, outperforming existing approaches.","Mingze Wang, Shuxian Bi, Wenjie Wang, Chongming Gao, Yangyang Li, Fuli Feng"
Efficiency and Effectiveness of LLM-Based Summarization of Evidence in Crowdsourced Fact-Checking,https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18265,"Evaluating the truthfulness of online content is critical for combating misinformation. This study examines the efficiency and effectiveness of crowdsourced truthfulness assessments through a comparative analysis of two approaches: one involving full-length webpages as evidence for each claim, and another using summaries for each evidence document generated with a large language model. Using an A/B testing setting, we engage a diverse pool of participants tasked with evaluating the truthfulness of statements under these conditions. Our analysis explores both the quality of assessments and the behavioral patterns of participants. The results reveal that relying on summarized evidence offers comparable accuracy and error metrics to the Standard modality while significantly improving efficiency. Workers in the Summary setting complete a significantly higher number of assessments, reducing task duration and costs. Additionally, the Summary modality maximizes internal agreement and maintains consistent reliance on and perceived usefulness of evidence, demonstrating its potential to streamline large-scale truthfulness evaluations.","Kevin Roitero, Dustin Wright, Michael Soprano, Isabelle Augenstein, Stefano Mizzaro"
Process-Supervised LLM Recommenders via Flow-guided Tuning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07377,"While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted for recommendation systems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), this approach amplifies popularity bias due to its likelihood maximization objective, compromising recommendation diversity and fairness. To address this, we present Flow-guided fine-tuning recommender (Flower), which replaces SFT with a Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) framework that enacts process supervision through token-level reward propagation. Flower's key innovation lies in decomposing item-level rewards into constituent token rewards, enabling direct alignment between token generation probabilities and their reward signals. This mechanism achieves three critical advancements: (1) popularity bias mitigation and fairness enhancement through empirical distribution matching, (2) preservation of diversity through GFlowNet's proportional sampling, and (3) flexible integration of personalized preferences via adaptable token rewards. Experiments demonstrate Flower's superior distribution-fitting capability and its significant advantages over traditional SFT in terms of accuracy, fairness, and diversity, highlighting its potential to improve LLM-based recommendation systems.

KAP: MLLM-assisted OCR Text Enhancement for Hybrid Retrieval in Chinese Non-Narrative Documents,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08452,"Hybrid Retrieval systems, combining Sparse and Dense Retrieval methods, struggle with Traditional Chinese non-narrative documents due to their complex formatting, rich vocabulary, and the insufficient understanding of Chinese synonyms by common embedding models. Previous approaches inadequately address the dual needs of these systems, focusing mainly on general text quality improvement rather than optimizing for retrieval. We propose Knowledge-Aware Preprocessing (KAP), a novel framework that transforms noisy OCR outputs into retrieval-optimized text. KAP adopts a two-stage approach: it first extracts text using OCR, then employs Multimodal Large Language Models to refine the output by integrating visual information from the original documents. This design reduces OCR noise, reconstructs structural elements, and formats the text to satisfy the distinct requirements of sparse and dense retrieval. Empirical results demonstrate that KAP consistently and significantly outperforms conventional preprocessing approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/JustinHsu1019/KAP.","Hsin-Ling Hsu, Ping-Sheng Lin, Jing-Di Lin, Jengnan Tzeng"
Can LLMs Be Trusted for Evaluating RAG Systems? A Survey of Methods and Datasets,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20119,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced significantly in recent years. The complexity of RAG systems, which involve multiple components-such as indexing, retrieval, and generation-along with numerous other parameters, poses substantial challenges for systematic evaluation and quality enhancement. Previous research highlights that evaluating RAG systems is essential for documenting advancements, comparing configurations, and identifying effective approaches for domain-specific applications. This study systematically reviews 63 academic articles to provide a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art RAG evaluation methodologies, focusing on four key areas: datasets, retrievers, indexing and databases, and the generator component. We observe the feasibility of an automated evaluation approach for each component of a RAG system, leveraging an LLM capable of both generating evaluation datasets and conducting evaluations. In addition, we found that further practical research is essential to provide companies with clear guidance on the do's and don'ts of implementing and evaluating RAG systems. By synthesizing evaluation approaches for key RAG components and emphasizing the creation and adaptation of domain-specific datasets for benchmarking, we contribute to the advancement of systematic evaluation methods and the improvement of evaluation rigor for RAG systems. Furthermore, by examining the interplay between automated approaches leveraging LLMs and human judgment, we contribute to the ongoing discourse on balancing automation and human input, clarifying their respective contributions, limitations, and challenges in achieving robust and reliable evaluations.","Lorenz Brehme, Thomas Str\""ohle, Ruth Breu"

| Cost and accuracy of long-term graph memory in distributed LLM-based multi-agent systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07978) | Distributed multi-agent systems use large language models to enable collaborative intelligence while preserving privacy, yet systematic evaluations of long-term memory under network constraints remain limited. This study presents a flexible testbed comparing mem0, a vector-based memory framework, and Graphiti, a graph-based knowledge graph, using the LOCOMO long-context benchmark. Experiments were conducted under unconstrained and constrained network conditions, measuring computational, financial, and accuracy metrics. Results indicate that mem0 significantly outperforms Graphiti in efficiency, with faster loading times, lower resource consumption, and minimal network overhead, while accuracy differences are not statistically significant. Applying a statistical pareto efficiency framework, mem0 is identified as the optimal choice that balances cost and accuracy in DMAS. | Benedict Wolff, Jacopo Bennati |
| VeriTaS: The First Dynamic Benchmark for Multimodal Automated Fact-Checking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08611](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08611) | The growing scale of online misinformation urgently demands Automated Fact-Checking (AFC). Existing benchmarks for evaluating AFC systems, however, are largely limited in terms of task scope, modalities, domain, language diversity, realism, or coverage of misinformation types. Critically, they are static, thus subject to data leakage as their claims enter the pretraining corpora of LLMs. As a result, benchmark performance no longer reliably reflects the actual ability to verify claims. We introduce Verified Theses and Statements (VeriTaS), the first dynamic benchmark for multimodal AFC, designed to remain robust under ongoing large-scale pretraining of foundation models. VeriTaS currently comprises 24,000 real-world claims from 108 professional fact-checking organizations across 54 languages, covering textual and audiovisual content. Claims are added quarterly via a fully automated seven-stage pipeline that normalizes claim formulation, retrieves original media, and maps heterogeneous expert verdicts to a novel, standardized, and disentangled scoring scheme with textual justifications. Through human evaluation, we demonstrate that the automated annotations closely match human judgments. We commit to update VeriTaS in the future, establishing a leakage-resistant benchmark, supporting meaningful AFC evaluation in the era of rapidly evolving foundation models. We will make the code and data publicly available. | Mark Rothermel, Marcus Kornmann, Marcus Rohrbach, Anna Rohrbach |
| FusID: Modality-Fused Semantic IDs for Generative Music Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08764](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08764) | Generative recommendation systems have achieved significant advances by leveraging semantic IDs to represent items. However, existing approaches that tokenize each modality independently face two critical limitations: (1) redundancy across modalities that reduces efficiency, and (2) failure to capture inter-modal interactions that limits item representation. We introduce FusID, a modality-fused semantic ID framework that addresses these limitations through three key components: (i) multimodal fusion that learns unified representations by jointly encoding information across modalities, (ii) representation learning that brings frequently co-occurring item embeddings closer while maintaining distinctiveness and preventing feature redundancy, and (iii) product quantization that converts the fused continuous embeddings into multiple discrete tokens to mitigate ID conflict. Evaluated on a multimodal next-song recommendation (i.e., playlist continuation) benchmark, FusID achieves zero ID conflicts, ensuring that each token sequence maps to exactly one song, mitigates codebook underutilization, and outperforms baselines in terms of MRR and Recall@k (k = 1, 5, 10, 20). | Haven Kim, Yupeng Hou, Julian McAuley |
| How role-play shapes relevance judgment in zero-shot LLM rankers | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17535) | Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising zero-shot rankers, but their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. In particular, role-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity, often give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms and diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both effective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how role-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal intervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how role-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the ranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in early layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while receiving limited interaction with query or document representations. Specifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information critical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on the inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for designing more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader opportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications. | Yumeng Wang, Jirui Qi, Catherine Chen, Panagiotis Eustratiadis, Suzan Verberne |

ScrapeGraphAI-100k: A Large-Scale Dataset for LLM-Based Web Information Extraction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15189,"The use of large language models for web information extraction is becoming increasingly fundamental to modern web information retrieval pipelines. However, existing datasets tend to be small, synthetic or text-only, failing to capture the structural context of the web. We introduce ScrapeGraphAI-100k, a large-scale dataset comprising real-world LLM extraction events, collected via opt-in ScrapeGraphAI telemetry during Q2 and Q3 of 2025. Starting from 9M events, we deduplicate and balance by schema to produce 93,695 examples spanning diverse domains and languages. Each instance includes Markdown content, a prompt, a JSON schema, the LLM response, and complexity/validation metadata. We characterize the datasets structural diversity and its failure modes as schema complexity increases. We also provide a fine-tuning experiment showing that a small language model (1.7B) trained on a subset narrows the gap to larger baselines (30B), underscoring the datasets utility for efficient extraction. ScrapeGraphAI-100k enables fine-tuning small models, benchmarking structured extraction, and studying schema induction for web IR indexing, and is publicly available on HuggingFace.","William Brach, Francesco Zuppichini, Marco Vinciguerra, Lorenzo Padoan"
Binge Watch: Reproducible Multimodal Benchmarks Datasets for Large-Scale Movie Recommendation on MovieLens-10M and 20M,https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15505,"With the growing interest in Multimodal Recommender Systems (MRSs), collecting high-quality datasets provided with multimedia side information (text, images, audio, video) has become a fundamental step. However, most of the current literature in the field relies on small- or medium-scale datasets that are either not publicly released or built using undocumented processes.
  In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by releasing M3L-10M and M3L-20M, two large-scale, reproducible, multimodal datasets for the movie domain, obtained by enriching with multimodal features the popular MovieLens-10M and MovieLens-20M, respectively. By following a fully documented pipeline, we collect movie plots, posters, and trailers, from which textual, visual, acoustic, and video features are extracted using several state-of-the-art encoders. We publicly release mappings to download the original raw data, the extracted features, and the complete datasets in multiple formats, fostering reproducibility and advancing the field of MRSs. In addition, we conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses that showcase our datasets across several perspectives.
  This work represents a foundational step to ensure reproducibility and replicability in the large-scale, multimodal movie recommendation domain.

OpenAIs HealthBench in Action: Evaluating an LLM-Based Medical Assistant on Realistic Clinical Queries,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02594,"Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems behave in complex, high-stakes clinical scenarios. Traditional evaluations are often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential competencies such as contextual reasoning, contextual awareness, and uncertainty handling.
  To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic RAG-based clinical support assistant, DR. INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR. INFO achieves a HealthBench Hard score of 0.68, outperforming leading frontier LLMs including the GPT-5 model family (GPT-5: 0.46, GPT-5.2: 0.42, GPT-5.1: 0.40), Grok 3 (0.23), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.19), and Claude 3.7 Sonnet (0.02) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness, instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence and Pathway.md, now DoxGPT by Doximity), it maintains a performance lead with a HealthBench Hard score of 0.72.
  These results highlight the strengths of DR. INFO in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and response completeness. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level, rubric-based evaluation for building reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled clinical support systems.","Sandhanakrishnan Ravichandran, Shivesh Kumar, Rogerio Corga Da Silva, Miguel Romano, Reinhard Berkels, Michiel van der Heijden, Olivier Fail, Valentine Emmanuel Gnanapragasam"

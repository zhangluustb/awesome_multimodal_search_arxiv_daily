Next-User Retrieval: Enhancing Cold-Start Recommendations via Generative Next-User Modeling,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15267,"The item cold-start problem is critical for online recommendation systems, as the success of this phase determines whether high-quality new items can transition to popular ones, receive essential feedback to inspire creators, and thus lead to the long-term retention of creators. However, modern recommendation systems still struggle to address item cold-start challenges due to the heavy reliance on item and historical interactions, which are non-trivial for cold-start items lacking sufficient exposure and feedback. Lookalike algorithms provide a promising solution by extending feedback for new items based on lookalike users. Traditional lookalike algorithms face such limitations: (1) failing to effectively model the lookalike users and further improve recommendations with the existing rule- or model-based methods; and (2) struggling to utilize the interaction signals and incorporate diverse features in modern recommendation systems.
  Inspired by lookalike algorithms, we propose Next-User Retrieval, a novel framework for enhancing cold-start recommendations via generative next-user modeling. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based model to capture the unidirectional relationships among recently interacted users and utilize these sequences to generate the next potential user who is most likely to interact with the item. The additional item features are also integrated as prefix prompt embeddings to assist the next-user generation. The effectiveness of Next-User Retrieval is evaluated through both offline experiments and online A/B tests. Our method achieves significant improvements with increases of 0.0142% in daily active users and +0.1144% in publications in Douyin, showcasing its practical applicability and scalability.","Yu-Ting Lan, Yang Huo, Yi Shen, Xiao Yang, Zuotao Liu"
DiscRec: Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative Modeling for Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15576,"Generative recommendation is emerging as a powerful paradigm that directly generates item predictions, moving beyond traditional matching-based approaches. However, current methods face two key challenges: token-item misalignment, where uniform token-level modeling ignores item-level granularity that is critical for collaborative signal learning, and semantic-collaborative signal entanglement, where collaborative and semantic signals exhibit distinct distributions yet are fused in a unified embedding space, leading to conflicting optimization objectives that limit the recommendation performance.
  To address these issues, we propose DiscRec, a novel framework that enables Disentangled Semantic-Collaborative signal modeling with flexible fusion for generative Recommendation.First, DiscRec introduces item-level position embeddings, assigned based on indices within each semantic ID, enabling explicit modeling of item structure in input token sequences.Second, DiscRec employs a dual-branch module to disentangle the two signals at the embedding layer: a semantic branch encodes semantic signals using original token embeddings, while a collaborative branch applies localized attention restricted to tokens within the same item to effectively capture collaborative signals. A gating mechanism subsequently fuses both branches while preserving the model's ability to model sequential dependencies. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that DiscRec effectively decouples these signals and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Aug2Search: Enhancing Facebook Marketplace Search with LLM-Generated Synthetic Data Augmentation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16065,"Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) is an important technique in modern search engines, enabling semantic match between search queries and relevant results. However, search logging data on platforms like Facebook Marketplace lacks the diversity and details needed for effective EBR model training, limiting the models' ability to capture nuanced search patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Aug2Search, an EBR-based framework leveraging synthetic data generated by Generative AI (GenAI) models, in a multimodal and multitask approach to optimize query-product relevance. This paper investigates the capabilities of GenAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in generating high-quality synthetic data, and analyzing its impact on enhancing EBR models. We conducted experiments using eight Llama models and 100 million data points from Facebook Marketplace logs. Our synthetic data generation follows three strategies: (1) generate queries, (2) enhance product listings, and (3) generate queries from enhanced listings. We train EBR models on three different datasets: sampled engagement data or original data ((e.g., ""Click"" and ""Listing Interactions"")), synthetic data, and a mixture of both engagement and synthetic data to assess their performance across various training sets. Our findings underscore the robustness of Llama models in producing synthetic queries and listings with high coherence, relevance, and diversity, while maintaining low levels of hallucination. Aug2Search achieves an improvement of up to 4% in ROC_AUC with 100 million synthetic data samples, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, our experiments reveal that with the same volume of training data, models trained exclusively on synthetic data often outperform those trained on original data only or a mixture of original and synthetic data.","Ruijie Xi, He Ba, Hao Yuan, Rishu Agrawal, Yuxin Tian, Ruoyan Long, Arul Prakash"
Generative Next POI Recommendation with Semantic ID,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01375,"Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation systems aim to predict the next destinations of user based on their preferences and historical check-ins. Existing generative POI recommendation methods usually employ random numeric IDs for POIs, limiting the ability to model semantic relationships between similar locations. In this paper, we propose Generative Next POI Recommendation with Semantic ID (GNPR-SID), an LLM-based POI recommendation model with a novel semantic POI ID (SID) representation method that enhances the semantic understanding of POI modeling. There are two key components in our GNPR-SID: (1) a Semantic ID Construction module that generates semantically rich POI IDs based on semantic and collaborative features, and (2) a Generative POI Recommendation module that fine-tunes LLMs to predict the next POI using these semantic IDs. By incorporating user interaction patterns and POI semantic features into the semantic ID generation, our method improves the recommendation accuracy and generalization of the model. To construct semantically related SIDs, we propose a POI quantization method based on residual quantized variational autoencoder, which maps POIs into a discrete semantic space. We also propose a diversity loss to ensure that SIDs are uniformly distributed across the semantic space. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNPR-SID substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 16% improvement in recommendation accuracy.","Dongsheng Wang, Yuxi Huang, Shen Gao, Yifan Wang, Chengrui Huang, Shuo Shang"

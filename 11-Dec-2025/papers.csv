MixLM: High-Throughput and Effective LLM Ranking via Text-Embedding Mix-Interaction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07846,"Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing semantic nuances and therefore show impressive relevance ranking performance in modern recommendation and search systems. However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. Comparing with strong baselines, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x under the same latency budget, while maintaining relevance metrics. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests.","Guoyao Li, Ran He, Shusen Jing, Kayhan Behdin, Yubo Wang, Sundara Raman Ramachandran, Chanh Nguyen, Jian Sheng, Xiaojing Ma, Chuanrui Zhu, Sriram Vasudevan, Muchen Wu, Sayan Ghosh, Lin Su, Qingquan Song, Xiaoqing Wang, Zhipeng Wang, Qing Lan, Yanning Chen, Jingwei Wu, Luke Simon, Wenjing Zhang, Qi Guo, Fedor Borisyuk"
Exploiting the Randomness of Large Language Models (LLM) in Text Classification Tasks: Locating Privileged Documents in Legal Matters,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08083,"In legal matters, text classification models are most often used to filter through large datasets in search of documents that meet certain pre-selected criteria like relevance to a certain subject matter, such as legally privileged communications and attorney-directed documents. In this context, large language models have demonstrated strong performance. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the role of randomness in LLM-based classification for attorney-client privileged document detection, focusing on four key dimensions: (1) the effectiveness of LLMs in identifying legally privileged documents, (2) the influence of randomness control parameters on classification outputs, (3) their impact on overall classification performance, and (4) a methodology for leveraging randomness to enhance accuracy. Experimental results showed that LLMs can identify privileged documents effectively, randomness control parameters have minimal impact on classification performance, and importantly, our developed methodology for leveraging randomness can have a significant impact on improving accuracy. Notably, this methodology that leverages randomness could also enhance a corporation's confidence in an LLM's output when incorporated into its sanctions-compliance processes. As organizations increasingly rely on LLMs to augment compliance workflows, reducing output variability helps build internal and regulatory confidence in LLM-derived sanctions-screening decisions.","Keith Huffman, Jianping Zhang, Nathaniel Huber-Fliflet, Fusheng Wei, Peter Gronvall"
VI-MMRec: Similarity-Aware Training Cost-free Virtual User-Item Interactions for Multimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08702,"Although existing multimodal recommendation models have shown promising performance, their effectiveness continues to be limited by the pervasive data sparsity problem. This problem arises because users typically interact with only a small subset of available items, leading existing models to arbitrarily treat unobserved items as negative samples. To this end, we propose VI-MMRec, a model-agnostic and training cost-free framework that enriches sparse user-item interactions via similarity-aware virtual user-item interactions. These virtual interactions are constructed based on modality-specific feature similarities of user-interacted items. Specifically, VI-MMRec introduces two different strategies: (1) Overlay, which independently aggregates modality-specific similarities to preserve modality-specific user preferences, and (2) Synergistic, which holistically fuses cross-modal similarities to capture complementary user preferences. To ensure high-quality augmentation, we design a statistically informed weight allocation mechanism that adaptively assigns weights to virtual user-item interactions based on dataset-specific modality relevance. As a plug-and-play framework, VI-MMRec seamlessly integrates with existing models to enhance their performance without modifying their core architecture. Its flexibility allows it to be easily incorporated into various existing models, maximizing performance with minimal implementation effort. Moreover, VI-MMRec introduces no additional overhead during training, making it significantly advantageous for practical deployment. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets using seven state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation models validate the effectiveness of our VI-MMRec.","Jinfeng Xu, Zheyu Chen, Shuo Yang, Jinze Li, Zitong Wan, Hewei Wang, Weijie Liu, Yijie Li, Edith C.

"PinRec: Outcome-Conditioned, Multi-Token Generative Retrieval for Industry-Scale Recommendation Systems",https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10507,"Generative retrieval methods utilize generative sequential modeling techniques, such as transformers, to generate candidate items for recommender systems. These methods have demonstrated promising results in academic benchmarks, surpassing traditional retrieval models like two-tower architectures. However, current generative retrieval methods lack the scalability required for industrial recommender systems, and they are insufficiently flexible to satisfy the multiple metric requirements of modern systems. This paper introduces PinRec, a novel generative retrieval model developed for applications at Pinterest. PinRec utilizes outcome-conditioned generation, enabling modelers to specify how to balance various outcome metrics, such as the number of saves and clicks, to effectively align with business goals and user exploration. Additionally, PinRec incorporates multi-token generation to enhance output diversity while optimizing generation. Our experiments demonstrate that PinRec can successfully balance performance, diversity, and efficiency, delivering a significant positive impact to users using generative models. This paper marks a significant milestone in generative retrieval, as it presents, to our knowledge, the first rigorous study on implementing generative retrieval at the scale of Pinterest.","Prabhat Agarwal, Anirudhan Badrinath, Laksh Bhasin, Jaewon Yang, Edoardo Botta, Jiajing Xu, Charles Rosenberg"
Personalize Before Retrieve: LLM-based Personalized Query Expansion for User-Centric Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08935,"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice, identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users. This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges, we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG systems.","Yingyi Zhang, Pengyue Jia, Derong Xu, Yi Wen, Xianneng Li, Yichao Wang, Wenlin Zhang, Xiaopeng Li, Weinan Gan, Huifeng Guo, Yong Liu, Xiangyu Zhao"

| WebRec: Enhancing LLM-based Recommendations with Attention-guided RAG from Web | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14182](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14182) | Recommender systems play a vital role in alleviating information overload and enriching users' online experience. In the era of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based recommender systems have emerged as a prevalent paradigm for advancing personalized recommendations. Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has drawn growing interest to facilitate the recommendation capability of LLMs, incorporating useful information retrieved from external knowledge bases. However, as a rich source of up-to-date information, the web remains under-explored by existing RAG-based recommendations. In particular, unique challenges are posed from two perspectives: one is to generate effective queries for web retrieval, considering the inherent knowledge gap between web search and recommendations; another challenge lies in harnessing online websites that contain substantial noisy content. To tackle these limitations, we propose WebRec, a novel web-based RAG framework, which takes advantage of the reasoning capability of LLMs to interpret recommendation tasks into queries of user preferences that cater to web retrieval. Moreover, given noisy web-retrieved information, where relevant pieces of evidence are scattered far apart, an insightful MP-Head is designed to enhance LLM attentions between distant tokens of relevant information via message passing. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed web-based RAG methods in recommendation scenarios. | Zihuai Zhao, Yujuan Ding, Wenqi Fan, Qing Li |
| LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization for Local-Life Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14221](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14221) | Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness. | Hao Jiang, Guoquan Wang, Donglin Zhou, Sheng Yu, Yang Zeng, Wencong Zeng, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou |
| Infer As You Train: A Symmetric Paradigm of Masked Generative for Click-Through Rate Prediction | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14403](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14403) | Generative models are increasingly being explored in click-through rate (CTR) prediction field to overcome the limitations of the conventional discriminative paradigm, which rely on a simple binary classification objective. However, existing generative models typically confine the generative paradigm to the training phase, primarily for representation learning. During online inference, they revert to a standard discriminative paradigm, failing to leverage their powerful generative capabilities to further improve prediction accuracy. This fundamental asymmetry between the training and inference phases prevents the generative paradigm from realizing its full potential. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetric Masked Generative Paradigm for CTR prediction (SGCTR), a novel framework that establishes symmetry between the training and inference phases. Specifically, after acquiring generative capabilities by learning feature dependencies during training, SGCTR applies the generative capabilities during online inference to iteratively redefine the features of input samples, which mitigates the impact of noisy features and enhances prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of SGCTR, demonstrating that applying the generative paradigm symmetrically across both training and inference significantly unlocks its power in CTR prediction. | Moyu Zhang, Yujun Jin, Yun Chen, Jinxin Hu, Yu Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng |
| LLMDistill4Ads: Using Cross-Encoders to Distill from LLM Signals for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03628](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03628) | E-commerce sellers are advised to bid on keyphrases to boost their advertising campaigns. These keyphrases must be relevant to prevent irrelevant items from cluttering search systems and to maintain positive seller perception. It is vital that keyphrase suggestions align with seller, search and buyer judgments. Given the challenges in collecting negative feedback in these systems, LLMs have been used as a scalable proxy to human judgments. This paper presents an empirical study on a major ecommerce platform of a distillation framework involving an LLM teacher, a cross-encoder assistant and a bi-encoder Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) student model, aimed at mitigating click-induced biases in keyphrase recommendations. | Soumik Dey, Benjamin Braun, Naveen Ravipati, Hansi Wu, Binbin Li |
| From Reasoning LLMs to BERT: A Two-Stage Distillation Framework for Search Relevance | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11056](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11056) | Query-service relevance prediction in e-commerce search systems faces strict latency requirements that prevent the direct application of Large Language Models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage reasoning distillation framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a powerful teacher LLM to a lightweight, deployment-friendly student model. In the first stage, we address the limitations of general-purpose LLMs by constructing a domain-adapted teacher model. This is achieved through a three-step process: domain-adaptive pre-training to inject platform knowledge, supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning skills, and preference optimization with a multi-dimensional reward model to ensure the generation of reliable and preference-aligned reasoning paths. This teacher can then automatically annotate massive query-service pairs from search logs with both relevance labels and reasoning chains. In the second stage, to address the challenges of architectural heterogeneity in standard distillation, we introduce Contrastive Reasoning Self-Distillation (CRSD). By modeling the behavior of the same student model under "standard" and "reasoning-augmented" inputs as a teacher-student relationship, CRSD enables the lightweight model to internalize the teacher's complex decision-making mechanisms without needing the explicit reasoning path at inference. Offline evaluations and online A/B testing in the Meituan search advertising system demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness and practical value. | Runze Xia, Yupeng Ji, Yuxi Zhou, Haodong Liu, Teng Zhang, Piji Li |
| MOON Embedding: Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Search Advertising | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11305](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11305) | We introduce MOON, our comprehensive set of sustainable iterative practices for multimodal representation learning for e-commerce applications. MOON has already been fully deployed across all stages of Taobao search advertising system, including retrieval, relevance, ranking, and so on. The performance gains are particularly significant on click-through rate (CTR) prediction task, which achieves an overall +20.00% online CTR improvement. Over the past three years, this project has delivered the largest improvement on CTR prediction task and undergone five full-scale iterations. Throughout the exploration and iteration of our MOON, we have accumulated valuable insights and practical experience that we believe will benefit the research community. MOON contains a three-stage training paradigm of "Pretraining, Post-training, and Application", allowing effective integration of multimodal representations with downstream tasks. Notably, to bridge the misalignment between the objectives of multimodal representation learning and downstream training, we define the exchange rate to quantify how effectively improvements in an intermediate metric can translate into downstream gains. Through this analysis, we identify the image-based search recall as a critical intermediate metric guiding the optimization of multimodal models. Over three years and five iterations, MOON has evolved along four critical dimensions: data processing, training strategy, model architecture, and downstream application. The lessons and insights gained through the iterative improvements will also be shared. As part of our exploration into scaling effects in the e-commerce field, we further conduct a systematic study of the scaling laws governing multimodal representation learning, examining multiple factors such as the number of training tokens, negative samples, and the length of user behavior sequences. | Chenghan Fu, Daoze Zhang, Yukang Lin, Zhanheng Nie, Xiang Zhang, Jianyu Liu, Yueran Liu, Wanxian Guan, Pengjie Wang, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng |
| MindRec: A Diffusion-driven Coarse-to-Fine Paradigm for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12597](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12597) | Recent advancements in large language model-based recommendation systems often represent items as text or semantic IDs and generate recommendations in an auto-regressive manner. However, due to the left-to-right greedy decoding strategy and the unidirectional logical flow, such methods often fail to produce globally optimal recommendations. In contrast, human reasoning does not follow a rigid left-to-right sequence. Instead, it often begins with keywords or intuitive insights, which are then refined and expanded. Inspired by this fact, we propose MindRec, a diffusion-driven coarse-to-fine generative paradigm that emulates human thought processes. Built upon a diffusion language model, MindRec departs from auto-regressive generation by leveraging a masked diffusion process to reconstruct items in a flexible, non-sequential manner. Particularly, our method first generates key tokens that reflect user preferences, and then expands them into the complete item, enabling adaptive and human-like generation. To further emulate the structured nature of human decision-making, we organize items into a hierarchical category tree. This structure guides the model to first produce the coarse-grained category and then progressively refine its selection through finer-grained subcategories before generating the specific item. To mitigate the local optimum problem inherent in greedy decoding, we design a novel beam search algorithm, Diffusion Beam Search, tailored for our mind-inspired generation paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that MindRec yields a 9.5\% average improvement in top-1 accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to enhance recommendation performance.

| MOON: Generative MLLM-based Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11999](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11999) | With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding. | Daoze Zhang, Chenghan Fu, Zhanheng Nie, Jianyu Liu, Wanxian Guan, Yuan Gao, Jun Song, Pengjie Wang, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng |

OxygenREC: An Instruction-Following Generative Framework for E-commerce Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22386,"Traditional recommendation systems suffer from inconsistency in multi-stage optimization objectives. Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder--decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm.","Xuegang Hao, Ming Zhang, Alex Li, Xiangyu Qian, Zhi Ma, Yanlong Zang, Shijie Yang, Zhongxuan Han, Xiaolong Ma, Jinguang Liu, Zhen Li, Zhida Jiang, Shusheng Wang, Ning Tang, Yanchen Qiao, Chenxiang Yang, Chen Sun, Jincheng Yuan, Chunhua Peng, Heng Hu, Peijun Yang, Baopeng Yuan, Caiyun Qiu, Zhaolong Xing, Haofei Yuan, Haipeng Zhang, Yuzhang Guo, Weijie Ding, Jiahua Gao, Hao Huang, Zhen Chen, Tongxuan Liu, Pinghua Gong"
HalluMat: Detecting Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Materials Science Content Through Multi-Stage Verification,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22396,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), is transforming scientific discovery, enabling rapid knowledge generation and hypothesis formulation. However, a critical challenge is hallucination, where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information, compromising research integrity. To address this, we introduce HalluMatData, a benchmark dataset for evaluating hallucination detection methods, factual consistency, and response robustness in AI-generated materials science content. Alongside this, we propose HalluMatDetector, a multi-stage hallucination detection framework that integrates intrinsic verification, multi-source retrieval, contradiction graph analysis, and metric-based assessment to detect and mitigate LLM hallucinations. Our findings reveal that hallucination levels vary significantly across materials science subdomains, with high-entropy queries exhibiting greater factual inconsistencies. By utilizing HalluMatDetector verification pipeline, we reduce hallucination rates by 30% compared to standard LLM outputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Paraphrased Hallucination Consistency Score (PHCS) to quantify inconsistencies in LLM responses across semantically equivalent queries, offering deeper insights into model reliability.","Bhanu Prakash Vangala, Sajid Mahmud, Pawan Neupane, Joel Selvaraj, Jianlin Cheng"
Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation Framework with Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization for Robust Early Pancreatic Neoplasm Detection in Multimodal CT Imaging,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23597,"The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.","Janani Annur Thiruvengadam, Kiran Mayee Nabigaru, Anusha Kovi"
"Don't Retrieve, Generate: Prompting LLMs for Synthetic Training Data in Dense Retrieval",https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21015,"Training effective dense retrieval models typically relies on hard negative (HN) examples mined from large document corpora using methods such as BM25 or cross-encoders, which require full corpus access and expensive index construction. We propose generating synthetic hard negatives directly from a provided query and positive passage, using Large Language Models(LLMs). We fine-tune DistilBERT using synthetic negatives generated by four state-of-the-art LLMs ranging from 4B to 30B parameters (Qwen3, LLaMA3, Phi4) and evaluate performance across 10 BEIR benchmark datasets. Contrary to the prevailing assumption that stronger generative models yield better synthetic data, find that our generative pipeline consistently underperforms traditional corpus-based mining strategies (BM25 and Cross-Encoder). Furthermore, we observe that scaling the generator model does not monotonically improve retrieval performance and find that the 14B parameter model outperforms the 30B model and in some settings it is the worst performing.",Aarush Sinha
Optimizing Generative Ranking Relevance via Reinforcement Learning in Xiaohongshu Search,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00968,"Ranking relevance is a fundamental task in search engines, aiming to identify the items most relevant to a given user query. Traditional relevance models typically produce scalar scores or directly predict relevance labels, limiting both interpretability and the modeling of complex relevance signals. Inspired by recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for complex tasks, we investigate whether explicit reasoning can enhance both interpretability and performance in relevance modeling. However, existing reasoning-based Generative Relevance Models (GRMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning on large amounts of human-annotated or synthetic CoT data, which often leads to limited generalization. Moreover, domain-agnostic, free-form reasoning tends to be overly generic and insufficiently grounded, limiting its potential to handle the diverse and ambiguous cases prevalent in open-domain search. In this work, we formulate relevance modeling in Xiaohongshu search as a reasoning task and introduce a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework to enhance the grounded reasoning capabilities of GRMs. Specifically, we incorporate practical business-specific relevance criteria into the multi-step reasoning prompt design and propose Stepwise Advantage Masking (SAM), a lightweight process-supervision strategy which facilitates effective learning of these criteria through improved credit assignment. To enable industrial deployment, we further distill the large-scale RL-tuned model to a lightweight version suitable for real-world search systems. Extensive offline evaluations and online A/B tests demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers significant improvements across key relevance and business metrics, validating its effectiveness, robustness, and practicality for large-scale industrial search systems.","Ziyang Zeng, Heming Jing, Jindong Chen, Xiangli Li, Hongyu Liu, Yixuan He, Zhengyu Li, Yige Sun, Zheyong Xie, Yuqing Yang, Shaosheng Cao, Jun Fan, Yi Wu, Yao Hu"

iTIMO: An LLM-empowered Synthesis Dataset for Travel Itinerary Modification,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10609,"Addressing itinerary modification is crucial for enhancing the travel experience as it is a frequent requirement during traveling. However, existing research mainly focuses on fixed itinerary planning, leaving modification underexplored. To bridge this gap, we formally define the itinerary modification task and introduce iTIMO, a dataset specifically tailored for this purpose. We identify the lack of {\itshape need-to-modify} itinerary data as the critical bottleneck hindering research on this task and propose a general pipeline to overcome it. This pipeline frames the generation of such data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real world itineraries using three atomic editing operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents, including disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation metric is designed to ensure perturbation effectiveness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on iTIMO, revealing the limitations of current LLMs and lead to several valuable directions for future research. Dataset and corresponding code are available at https://github.com/zelo2/iTIMO.","Zhuoxuan Huang, Yunshan Ma, Hongyu Zhang, Hua Ma, Zhu Sun"
Introducing Axlerod: An LLM-based Chatbot for Assisting Independent Insurance Agents,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09715,"The insurance industry is undergoing a paradigm shift through the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly in the realm of intelligent conversational agents. Chatbots have evolved into sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of automating complex workflows, including policy recommendation and claims triage, while simultaneously enabling dynamic, context-aware user engagement. This paper presents the design, implementation, and empirical evaluation of Axlerod, an AI-powered conversational interface designed to improve the operational efficiency of independent insurance agents. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and domain-specific knowledge integration, Axlerod demonstrates robust capabilities in parsing user intent, accessing structured policy databases, and delivering real-time, contextually relevant responses. Experimental results underscore Axlerod's effectiveness, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.18% in policy retrieval tasks while reducing the average search time by 2.42 seconds. This work contributes to the growing body of research on enterprise-grade AI applications in insurtech, with a particular focus on agent-assistive rather than consumer-facing architectures.","Adam Bradley, John Hastings, Khandaker Mamun Ahmed"
Continuum Memory Architectures for Long-Horizon LLM Agents,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09913,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.",Joe Logan
FaTRQ: Tiered Residual Quantization for LLM Vector Search in Far-Memory-Aware ANNS Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09985,"Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.","Tianqi Zhang, Flavio Ponzina, Tajana Rosing"
An Efficient Long-Context Ranking Architecture With Calibrated LLM Distillation: Application to Person-Job Fit,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10321,"Finding the most relevant person for a job proposal in real time is challenging, especially when resumes are long, structured, and multilingual. In this paper, we propose a re-ranking model based on a new generation of late cross-attention architecture, that decomposes both resumes and project briefs to efficiently handle long-context inputs with minimal computational overhead. To mitigate historical data biases, we use a generative large language model (LLM) as a teacher, generating fine-grained, semantically grounded supervision. This signal is distilled into our student model via an enriched distillation loss function. The resulting model produces skill-fit scores that enable consistent and interpretable person-job matching. Experiments on relevance, ranking, and calibration metrics demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.","Warren Jouanneau, Emma Jouffroy, Marc Palyart"
Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478,"Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as ""diversity"" or ""debiasing"", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

MM-BRIGHT: A Multi-Task Multimodal Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09562,"Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of text-based queries where keyword or semantic matching is usually sufficient. Many real-world queries contain multimodal elements, particularly, images such as diagrams, charts, and screenshots that require intensive reasoning to identify relevant documents. To address this gap, we introduce MM-BRIGHT, the first multimodal benchmark for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Our dataset consists of 2,803 real-world queries spanning 29 diverse technical domains, with four tasks of increasing complexity: text-to-text, multimodal-to-text, multimodal-to-image, and multimodal-to-multimodal retrieval. Extensive evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle across all tasks: BM25 achieves only 8.5 nDCG@10 on text-only retrieval, while the best multimodal model Nomic-Vision reaches just 27.6 nDCG@10 on multimodal-to-text retrieval actually underperforming the best text-only model (DiVeR: 32.2). These results highlight substantial headroom and position MM-BRIGHT as a testbed for next-generation retrieval models that better integrate visual reasoning. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/mm-bright/MM-BRIGHT.

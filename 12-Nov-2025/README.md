| Customized Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LLM for Debiasing Recommendation Unlearning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05494](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05494) | Modern recommender systems face a critical challenge in complying with privacy regulations like the 'right to be forgotten': removing a user's data without disrupting recommendations for others. Traditional unlearning methods address this by partial model updates, but introduce propagation bias--where unlearning one user's data distorts recommendations for behaviorally similar users, degrading system accuracy. While retraining eliminates bias, it is computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems. To address this challenge, we propose CRAGRU, a novel framework leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficient, user-specific unlearning that mitigates bias while preserving recommendation quality. CRAGRU decouples unlearning into distinct retrieval and generation stages. In retrieval, we employ three tailored strategies designed to precisely isolate the target user's data influence, minimizing collateral impact on unrelated users and enhancing unlearning efficiency. Subsequently, the generation stage utilizes an LLM, augmented with user profiles integrated into prompts, to reconstruct accurate and personalized recommendations without needing to retrain the entire base model. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CRAGRU effectively unlearns targeted user data, significantly mitigating unlearning bias by preventing adverse impacts on non-target users, while maintaining recommendation performance comparable to fully trained original models. Our work highlights the promise of RAG-based architectures for building robust and privacy-preserving recommender systems.

| DOCUEVAL: An LLM-based AI Engineering Tool for Building Customisable Document Evaluation Workflows | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05496](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05496) | Foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs), have the potential to streamline evaluation workflows and improve their performance. However, practical adoption faces challenges, such as customisability, accuracy, and scalability. In this paper, we present DOCUEVAL, an AI engineering tool for building customisable DOCUment EVALuation workflows. DOCUEVAL supports advanced document processing and customisable workflow design which allow users to define theory-grounded reviewer roles, specify evaluation criteria, experiment with different reasoning strategies and choose the assessment style. To ensure traceability, DOCUEVAL provides comprehensive logging of every run, along with source attribution and configuration management, allowing systematic comparison of results across alternative setups. By integrating these capabilities, DOCUEVAL directly addresses core software engineering challenges, including how to determine whether evaluators are "good enough" for deployment and how to empirically compare different evaluation strategies. We demonstrate the usefulness of DOCUEVAL through a real-world academic peer review case, showing how DOCUEVAL enables both the engineering of evaluators and scalable, reliable document evaluation. | Hao Zhang, Qinghua Lu, Liming Zhu |
| Socially Aware Music Recommendation: A Multi-Modal Graph Neural Networks for Collaborative Music Consumption and Community-Based Engagement | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05497](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05497) | This study presents a novel Multi-Modal Graph Neural Network (MM-GNN) framework for socially aware music recommendation, designed to enhance personalization and foster community-based engagement. The proposed model introduces a fusion-free deep mutual learning strategy that aligns modality-specific representations from lyrics, audio, and visual data while maintaining robustness against missing modalities. A heterogeneous graph structure is constructed to capture both user-song interactions and user-user social relationships, enabling the integration of individual preferences with social influence. Furthermore, emotion-aware embeddings derived from acoustic and textual signals contribute to emotionally aligned recommendations. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various performance metrics. Ablation studies further validate the critical impact of each model component, confirming the effectiveness of the framework in delivering accurate and socially contextualized music recommendations. | Kajwan Ziaoddini |
| SARCH: Multimodal Search for Archaeological Archives | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05667](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05667) | In this paper, we describe a multi-modal search system designed to search old archaeological books and reports. This corpus is digitally available as scanned PDFs, but varies widely in the quality of scans. Our pipeline, designed for multi-modal archaeological documents, extracts and indexes text, images (classified into maps, photos, layouts, and others), and tables. We evaluated different retrieval strategies, including keyword-based search, embedding-based models, and a hybrid approach that selects optimal results from both modalities. We report and analyze our preliminary results and discuss future work in this exciting vertical. | Nivedita Sinha, Bharati Khanijo, Sanskar Singh, Priyansh Mahant, Ashutosh Roy, Saubhagya Singh Bhadouria, Arpan Jain, Maya Ramanath |
| A Remarkably Efficient Paradigm to Multimodal Large Language Models for Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05885](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05885) | Sequential recommendations (SR) predict users' future interactions based on their historical behavior. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought powerful generative and reasoning capabilities, significantly enhancing SR performance, while Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) further extend this by introducing data like images and interactive relationships. However, critical issues remain, i.e., (a) Suboptimal item representations caused by lengthy and redundant descriptions, leading to inefficiencies in both training and inference; (b) Modality-related cognitive bias, as LLMs are predominantly pretrained on textual data, limiting their ability to effectively integrate and utilize non-textual modalities; (c) Weakening sequential perception in long interaction sequences, where attention mechanisms struggle to capture earlier interactions, hindering the modeling of long-range dependencies. To address these issues, we propose Speeder, an efficient MLLM-based paradigm for SR featuring three key innovations: 1) Multimodal Representation Compression (MRC), which condenses item attributes into concise yet informative tokens, reducing redundancy and computational cost; 2) Modality-aware Progressive Optimization (MPO), enabling gradual learning of multimodal representations; 3) Sequential Position Awareness Enhancement (SPAE), improving the LLM's capability to capture both relative and absolute sequential dependencies in long interaction sequences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Speeder. Speeder increases training speed to 250% of the original while reducing inference time to 25% on the Amazon dataset. | Qiyong Zhong, Jiajie Su, Ming Yang, Yunshan Ma, Xiaolin Zheng, Chaochao Chen |
| LLaDA-Rec: Discrete Diffusion for Parallel Semantic ID Generation in Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06254](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06254) | Generative recommendation represents each item as a semantic ID, i.e., a sequence of discrete tokens, and generates the next item through autoregressive decoding. While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation. By combining bidirectional attention with the adaptive generation order, the approach models inter-item and intra-item dependencies more effectively and alleviates error accumulation. Specifically, our approach comprises three key designs: (1) a parallel tokenization scheme that produces semantic IDs for bidirectional modeling, addressing the mismatch between residual quantization and bidirectional architectures; (2) two masking mechanisms at the user-history and next-item levels to capture both inter-item sequential dependencies and intra-item semantic relationships; and (3) an adapted beam search strategy for adaptive-order discrete diffusion decoding, resolving the incompatibility of standard beam search with diffusion-based generation. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that LLaDA-Rec consistently outperforms both ID-based and state-of-the-art generative recommenders, establishing discrete diffusion as a new paradigm for generative recommendation. | Teng Shi, Chenglei Shen, Weijie Yu, Shen Nie, Chongxuan Li, Xiao Zhang, Ming He, Yan Han, Jun Xu |
| TOOL4POI: A Tool-Augmented LLM Framework for Next POI Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06405) | Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a fundamental task in location-based services. While recent advances leverage Large Language Model (LLM) for sequential modeling, existing LLM-based approaches face two key limitations: (i) strong reliance on the contextual completeness of user histories, resulting in poor performance on out-of-history (OOH) scenarios; (ii) limited scalability, due to the restricted context window of LLMs, which limits their ability to access and process a large number of candidate POIs. To address these challenges, we propose Tool4POI, a novel tool-augmented framework that enables LLMs to perform open-set POI recommendation through external retrieval and reasoning. Tool4POI consists of three key modules: preference extraction module, multi-turn candidate retrieval module, and reranking module, which together summarize long-term user interests, interact with external tools to retrieve relevant POIs, and refine final recommendations based on recent behaviors. Unlike existing methods, Tool4POI requires no task-specific fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that Tool4POI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 40% accuracy on challenging OOH scenarios where existing methods fail, and delivering average improvements of 20% and 30% on Acc@5 and Acc@10, respectively. | Dongsheng Wang, Shen Gao, Chengrui Huang, Yuxi Huang, Ruixiang Feng, Shuo Shang |
| Can LLM Annotations Replace User Clicks for Learning to Rank? | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06635](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06635) | Large-scale supervised data is essential for training modern ranking models, but obtaining high-quality human annotations is costly. Click data has been widely used as a low-cost alternative, and with recent advances in large language models (LLMs), LLM-based relevance annotation has emerged as another promising annotation. This paper investigates whether LLM annotations can replace click data for learning to rank (LTR) by conducting a comprehensive comparison across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both a public dataset, TianGong-ST, and an industrial dataset, Baidu-Click, show that click-supervised models perform better on high-frequency queries, while LLM annotation-supervised models are more effective on medium- and low-frequency queries. Further analysis shows that click-supervised models are better at capturing document-level signals such as authority or quality, while LLM annotation-supervised models are more effective at modeling semantic matching between queries and documents and at distinguishing relevant from non-relevant documents. Motivated by these observations, we explore two training strategies -- data scheduling and frequency-aware multi-objective learning -- that integrate both supervision signals. Both approaches enhance ranking performance across queries at all frequency levels, with the latter being more effective.

| AGRAG: Advanced Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05549) | Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-based RAG) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured knowledge. However, existing methods face three critical challenges: Inaccurate Graph Construction, caused by LLM hallucination; Poor Reasoning Ability, caused by failing to generate explicit reasons telling LLM why certain chunks were selected; and Inadequate Answering, which only partially answers the query due to the inadequate LLM reasoning, making their performance lag behind NaiveRAG on certain tasks. To address these issues, we propose AGRAG, an advanced graph-based retrieval-augmented generation framework. When constructing the graph, AGRAG substitutes the widely used LLM entity extraction method with a statistics-based method, avoiding hallucination and error propagation. When retrieval, AGRAG formulates the graph reasoning procedure as the Minimum Cost Maximum Influence (MCMI) subgraph generation problem, where we try to include more nodes with high influence score, but with less involving edge cost, to make the generated reasoning paths more comprehensive. We prove this problem to be NP-hard, and propose a greedy algorithm to solve it. The MCMI subgraph generated can serve as explicit reasoning paths to tell LLM why certain chunks were retrieved, thereby making the LLM better focus on the query-related part contents of the chunks, reducing the impact of noise, and improving AGRAG's reasoning ability. Furthermore, compared with the simple tree-structured reasoning paths, our MCMI subgraph can allow more complex graph structures, such as cycles, and improve the comprehensiveness of the generated reasoning paths. | Yubo Wang, Haoyang Li, Fei Teng, Lei Chen |
| Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations with Vision-Language Models and Information-Aware Fusion | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02113](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02113) | Recent advances in multimodal recommendation (MMR) highlight the potential of integrating visual and textual content to enrich item representations. However, existing methods often rely on coarse visual features and naive fusion strategies, resulting in redundant or misaligned representations. From an information-theoretic perspective, effective fusion should balance unique, shared, and redundant modality information to preserve complementary cues. To this end, we propose VIRAL, a novel Vision-Language and Information-aware Recommendation framework that enhances multimodal fusion through two components: (i) a VLM-based visual enrichment module that generates fine-grained, title-guided descriptions for semantically aligned image representations, and (ii) an information-aware fusion module inspired by Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to disentangle and integrate complementary signals. Experiments on three Amazon datasets show that VIRAL consistently outperforms strong multimodal baselines and substantially improves the contribution of visual features. | Hai-Dang Kieu, Min Xu, Thanh Trung Huynh, Dung D.

| Cross-Platform E-Commerce Product Categorization and Recategorization: A Multimodal Hierarchical Classification Approach | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20013](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20013) | This study addresses critical industrial challenges in e-commerce product categorization, namely platform heterogeneity and the structural limitations of existing taxonomies, by developing and deploying a multimodal hierarchical classification framework. Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40 international fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features (RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision-language representations (CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and attention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic masking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings combined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical F1 (98.59%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or inconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised "product recategorization" pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which discovered new, fine-grained categories (for example, subtypes of "Shoes") with cluster purities above 86%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a deployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy with diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more effectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's industrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction intelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining a lightweight RoBERTa stage with a GPU-accelerated multimodal stage to balance cost and accuracy. | Lotte Gross, Rebecca Walter, Nicole Zoppi, Adrien Justus, Alessandro Gambetti, Qiwei Han, Maximilian Kaiser |

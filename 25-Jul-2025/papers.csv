LLM-based Embedders for Prior Case Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18455,"In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR. LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.","Damith Premasiri, Tharindu Ranasinghe, Ruslan Mitkov"
How Well Do LLMs Predict Prerequisite Skills? Zero-Shot Comparison to Expert-Defined Concepts,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18479,"Prerequisite skills - foundational competencies required before mastering more advanced concepts - are important for supporting effective learning, assessment, and skill-gap analysis. Traditionally curated by domain experts, these relationships are costly to maintain and difficult to scale. This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can predict prerequisite skills in a zero-shot setting, using only natural language descriptions and without task-specific fine-tuning. We introduce ESCO-PrereqSkill, a benchmark dataset constructed from the ESCO taxonomy, comprising 3,196 skills and their expert-defined prerequisite links. Using a standardized prompting strategy, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini, LLaMA 4, Qwen2, and DeepSeek, across semantic similarity, BERTScore, and inference latency. Our results show that models such as LLaMA4-Maverick, Claude-3-7-Sonnet, and Qwen2-72B generate predictions that closely align with expert ground truth, demonstrating strong semantic reasoning without supervision. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support scalable prerequisite skill modeling for applications in personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, and skill-based recommender systems.","Ngoc Luyen Le, Marie-H\'el\`ene Abel"
The Best is Yet to Come: Graph Convolution in the Testing Phase for Multimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18489,"The efficiency and scalability of graph convolution networks (GCNs) in training recommender systems remain critical challenges, hindering their practical deployment in real-world scenarios. In the multimodal recommendation (MMRec) field, training GCNs requires more expensive time and space costs and exacerbates the gap between different modalities, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation accuracy. This paper critically points out the inherent challenges associated with adopting GCNs during the training phase in MMRec, revealing that GCNs inevitably create unhelpful and even harmful pairs during model optimization and isolate different modalities. To this end, we propose FastMMRec, a highly efficient multimodal recommendation framework that deploys graph convolutions exclusively during the testing phase, bypassing their use in training. We demonstrate that adopting GCNs solely in the testing phase significantly improves the model's efficiency and scalability while alleviating the modality isolation problem often caused by using GCNs during the training phase. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, consistently demonstrating the performance superiority of FastMMRec over competitive baselines while achieving efficiency and scalability.","Jinfeng Xu, Zheyu Chen, Shuo Yang, Jinze Li, Edith C.

LLM Alignment as Retriever Optimization: An Information Retrieval Perspective,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03699,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence with capabilities in reasoning, coding, and communication, driving innovation across industries. Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.","Bowen Jin, Jinsung Yoon, Zhen Qin, Ziqi Wang, Wei Xiong, Yu Meng, Jiawei Han, Sercan O.

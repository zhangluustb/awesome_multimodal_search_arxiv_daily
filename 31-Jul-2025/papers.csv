Generative Recommendation with Semantic IDs: A Practitioner's Handbook,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22224,"Generative recommendation (GR) has gained increasing attention for its promising performance compared to traditional models. A key factor contributing to the success of GR is the semantic ID (SID), which converts continuous semantic representations (e.g., from large language models) into discrete ID sequences. This enables GR models with SIDs to both incorporate semantic information and learn collaborative filtering signals, while retaining the benefits of discrete decoding. However, varied modeling techniques, hyper-parameters, and experimental setups in existing literature make direct comparisons between GR proposals challenging. Furthermore, the absence of an open-source, unified framework hinders systematic benchmarking and extension, slowing model iteration. To address this challenge, our work introduces and open-sources a framework for Generative Recommendation with semantic ID, namely GRID, specifically designed for modularity to facilitate easy component swapping and accelerate idea iteration. Using GRID, we systematically experiment with and ablate different components of GR models with SIDs on public benchmarks. Our comprehensive experiments with GRID reveal that many overlooked architectural components in GR models with SIDs substantially impact performance. This offers both novel insights and validates the utility of an open-source platform for robust benchmarking and GR research advancement. GRID is open-sourced at https://github.com/snap-research/GRID.","Clark Mingxuan Ju, Liam Collins, Leonardo Neves, Bhuvesh Kumar, Louis Yufeng Wang, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah"
Multi-modal Relational Item Representation Learning for Inferring Substitutable and Complementary Items,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22268,"We introduce a novel self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning framework designed to infer substitutable and complementary items. Existing approaches primarily focus on modeling item-item associations deduced from user behaviors using graph neural networks (GNNs) or leveraging item content information. However, these methods often overlook critical challenges, such as noisy user behavior data and data sparsity due to the long-tailed distribution of these behaviors. In this paper, we propose MMSC, a self-supervised multi-modal relational item representation learning framework to address these challenges. Specifically, MMSC consists of three main components: (1) a multi-modal item representation learning module that leverages a multi-modal foundational model and learns from item metadata, (2) a self-supervised behavior-based representation learning module that denoises and learns from user behavior data, and (3) a hierarchical representation aggregation mechanism that integrates item representations at both the semantic and task levels. Additionally, we leverage LLMs to generate augmented training data, further enhancing the denoising process during training. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets, showing that MMSC outperforms existing baselines by 26.1% for substitutable recommendation and 39.2% for complementary recommendation. In addition, we empirically show that MMSC is effective in modeling cold-start items.","Junting Wang, Chenghuan Guo, Jiao Yang, Yanhui Guo, Yan Gao, Hari Sundaram"
GeoOutageKG: A Multimodal Geospatiotemporal Knowledge Graph for Multiresolution Power Outage Analysis,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22878,"Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year, exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events. However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology, GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from 2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and reusable semantic resource that enables robust multimodal data integration. We demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power outages.","Ethan Frakes, Yinghui Wu, Roger H. French, Mengjie Li"
"Conversational LLMs Simplify Secure Clinical Data Access, Understanding, and Analysis",https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01053,"As ever-larger clinical datasets become available, they have the potential to unlock unprecedented opportunities for medical research. Foremost among them is Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest open-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets, particularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to understand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant barrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to understanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the hosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers converse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural language; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query against the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the underlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show that minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that once demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the complexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the broader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates the translation of raw records into actionable insight.","Rafi Al Attrach, Pedro Moreira, Rajna Fani, Renato Umeton, Leo Anthony Celi"

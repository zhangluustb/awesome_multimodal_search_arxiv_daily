| CoNRec: Context-Discerning Negative Recommendation with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15721](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15721) | Understanding what users like is relatively straightforward; understanding what users dislike, however, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals. | Xinda Chen, Jiawei Wu, Yishuang Liu, Jialin Zhu, Shuwen Xiao, Junjun Zheng, Xiangheng Kong, Yuning Jiang |
| CGPT: Cluster-Guided Partial Tables with LLM-Generated Supervision for Table Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15849](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15849) | General-purpose embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in text retrieval but remain suboptimal for table retrieval, where highly structured content leads to semantic compression and query-table mismatch. Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

| MMGRid: Navigating Temporal-aware and Cross-domain Generative Recommendation via Model Merging | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15930](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15930) | Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments. | Tianjun Wei, Enneng Yang, Yingpeng Du, Huizhong Guo, Jie Zhang, Zhu Sun |
| MALTopic: Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15299) | Topic modeling is a crucial technique for extracting latent themes from unstructured text data, particularly valuable in analyzing survey responses. However, traditional methods often only consider free-text responses and do not natively incorporate structured or categorical survey responses for topic modeling. And they produce abstract topics, requiring extensive human interpretation. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework (MALTopic). This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data. | Yash Sharma |
| Eliminating Out-of-Domain Recommendations in LLM-based Recommender Systems: A Unified View | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03336](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03336) | Recommender systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) are often plagued by hallucinations of out-of-domain (OOD) items. To address this, we propose RecLM, a unified framework that bridges the gap between retrieval and generation by instantiating three grounding paradigms under a single architecture: embedding-based retrieval, constrained generation over rewritten item titles, and discrete item-tokenizer generation. Using the same backbone LLM and prompts, we systematically compare these three views on public benchmarks. RecLM strictly eradicates OOD recommendations (OOD@10 = 0) across all variants, and the constrained generation variants RecLM-cgen and RecLM-token achieve overall state-of-the-art accuracy compared to both strong ID-based and LLM-based baselines. Our unified view provides a systematic basis for comparing three distinct paradigms to reduce item hallucinations, offering a practical framework to facilitate the application of LLMs to recommendation tasks.

| Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665) | Large language models (LLMs) based recommender systems (RecSys) can adapt to different domains flexibly. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, encompassing implicit feedback such as clicked items and explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed by novel privacy attacks. However, no study has been conducted on this important issue. We design several membership inference attacks (MIAs) aimed to revealing whether system prompts include victims' historical interactions. The attacks are \emph{Similarity, Memorization, Inquiry, and Poisoning attacks}, each utilizing unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on five of the latest open-source LLMs and three well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat to LLM RecSys is realistic: inquiry and poisoning attacks show significantly high attack advantages. We also discussed possible methods to mitigate such MIA threats. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts, the position of the victim in the shots, the number of poisoning items in the prompt,etc. | Jiajie He, Min-Chun Chen, Xintong Chen, Xinyang Fang, Yuechun Gu, Keke Chen |
| Does LLM Focus on the Right Words? Mitigating Context Bias in LLM-based Recommenders | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10978) | Large language models (LLMs), owing to their extensive open-domain knowledge and semantic reasoning capabilities, have been increasingly integrated into recommender systems (RS). However, a substantial gap remains between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the specific requirements of recommendation tasks. To address this gap, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly performed on specially curated recommendation datasets to further enhance their predictive ability. Despite its success, SFT exhibits a critical limitation: it induces Context Bias, whereby the model over-relies on auxiliary tokens, such as task descriptions and prefix-generated tokens, while underutilizing core user interaction tokens that encode user-specific preferences. This bias not only undermines recommendation accuracy but also raises unfairness concerns. To address this issue, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Optimization-based Tuning (GDRT), a novel fine-tuning paradigm that enforces consistent model performance across token groups with varying degrees of relevance to auxiliary tokens. By adaptively upweighting underperforming groups, typically those weakly correlated with auxiliary tokens, GDRT shifts the model's attention from superficial auxiliary cues to informative user interaction tokens, thereby mitigating context bias. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that GDRT effectively mitigates context bias, yielding substantial improvements in recommendation accuracy (with an average NDCG@10 gain of 24.29%) and significantly enhancing recommendation fairness.

| iTIMO: An LLM-empowered Synthesis Dataset for Travel Itinerary Modification | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10609](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10609) | Addressing itinerary modification is crucial for enhancing the travel experience as it is a frequent requirement during traveling. However, existing research mainly focuses on fixed itinerary planning, leaving modification underexplored due to the scarcity of need-to-modify itinerary data. To bridge this gap, we formally define the itinerary modification task and propose a general pipeline to construct the corresponding dataset, namely iTIMO. This pipeline frames the generation of need-to-modify itinerary data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real-world itineraries using three operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents: disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, hybrid evaluation metrics are introduced to ensure perturbation effectiveness. We conduct comprehensive benchmarking on iTIMO to analyze the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs. Overall, iTIMO provides a comprehensive testbed for the modification task, and empowers the evolution of traditional travel recommender systems into adaptive frameworks capable of handling dynamic travel needs.

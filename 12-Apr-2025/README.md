| DashCLIP: Leveraging multimodal models for generating semantic embeddings for DoorDash | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07110](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07110) | Despite the success of vision-language models in various generative tasks, obtaining high-quality semantic representations for products and user intents is still challenging due to the inability of off-the-shelf models to capture nuanced relationships between the entities. In this paper, we introduce a joint training framework for product and user queries by aligning uni-modal and multi-modal encoders through contrastive learning on image-text data. Our novel approach trains a query encoder with an LLM-curated relevance dataset, eliminating the reliance on engagement history. These embeddings demonstrate strong generalization capabilities and improve performance across applications, including product categorization and relevance prediction. For personalized ads recommendation, a significant uplift in the click-through rate and conversion rate after the deployment further confirms the impact on key business metrics. We believe that the flexibility of our framework makes it a promising solution toward enriching the user experience across the e-commerce landscape. | Omkar Gurjar, Kin Sum Liu, Praveen Kolli, Utsaw Kumar, Mandar Rahurkar |
| Towards Distribution Matching between Collaborative and Language Spaces for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07363](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07363) | Generative recommendation aims to learn the underlying generative process over the entire item set to produce recommendations for users. Although it leverages non-linear probabilistic models to surpass the limited modeling capacity of linear factor models, it is often constrained by a trade-off between representation ability and tractability. With the rise of a new generation of generative methods based on pre-trained language models (LMs), incorporating LMs into general recommendation with implicit feedback has gained considerable attention. However, adapting them to generative recommendation remains challenging. The core reason lies in the mismatch between the input-output formats and semantics of generative models and LMs, making it challenging to achieve optimal alignment in the feature space. This work addresses this issue by proposing a model-agnostic generative recommendation framework called DMRec, which introduces a probabilistic meta-network to bridge the outputs of LMs with user interactions, thereby enabling an equivalent probabilistic modeling process. Subsequently, we design three cross-space distribution matching processes aimed at maximizing shared information while preserving the unique semantics of each space and filtering out irrelevant information. We apply DMRec to three different types of generative recommendation methods and conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DMRec can effectively enhance the recommendation performance of these generative models, and it shows significant advantages over mainstream LM-enhanced recommendation methods. | Yi Zhang, Yiwen Zhang, Yu Wang, Tong Chen, Hongzhi Yin |
| LLM4Ranking: An Easy-to-use Framework of Utilizing Large Language Models for Document Reranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07439](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07439) | Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for document reranking has been a popular and promising research direction in recent years, many studies are dedicated to improving the performance and efficiency of using LLMs for reranking. Besides, it can also be applied in many real-world applications, such as search engines or retrieval-augmented generation. In response to the growing demand for research and application in practice, we introduce a unified framework, \textbf{LLM4Ranking}, which enables users to adopt different ranking methods using open-source or closed-source API-based LLMs. Our framework provides a simple and extensible interface for document reranking with LLMs, as well as easy-to-use evaluation and fine-tuning scripts for this task. We conducted experiments based on this framework and evaluated various models and methods on several widely used datasets, providing reproducibility results on utilizing LLMs for document reranking. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/liuqi6777/llm4ranking. | Qi Liu, Haozhe Duan, Yiqun Chen, Quanfeng Lu, Weiwei Sun, Jiaxin Mao |
| CollEX -- A Multimodal Agentic RAG System Enabling Interactive Exploration of Scientific Collections | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07643](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07643) | In this paper, we introduce CollEx, an innovative multimodal agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to enhance interactive exploration of extensive scientific collections. Given the overwhelming volume and inherent complexity of scientific collections, conventional search systems often lack necessary intuitiveness and interactivity, presenting substantial barriers for learners, educators, and researchers. CollEx addresses these limitations by employing state-of-the-art Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as multimodal agents accessible through an intuitive chat interface. By abstracting complex interactions via specialized agents equipped with advanced tools, CollEx facilitates curiosity-driven exploration, significantly simplifying access to diverse scientific collections and records therein. Our system integrates textual and visual modalities, supporting educational scenarios that are helpful for teachers, pupils, students, and researchers by fostering independent exploration as well as scientific excitement and curiosity. Furthermore, CollEx serves the research community by discovering interdisciplinary connections and complementing visual data. We illustrate the effectiveness of our system through a proof-of-concept application containing over 64,000 unique records across 32 collections from a local scientific collection from a public university. | Florian Schneider, Narges Baba Ahmadi, Niloufar Baba Ahmadi, Iris Vogel, Martin Semmann, Chris Biemann |
| FairEval: Evaluating Fairness in LLM-Based Recommendations with Personality Awareness | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07801](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07801) | Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their application to recommender systems (RecLLMs), yet concerns remain regarding fairness across demographic and psychological user dimensions. We introduce FairEval, a novel evaluation framework to systematically assess fairness in LLM-based recommendations. FairEval integrates personality traits with eight sensitive demographic attributes,including gender, race, and age, enabling a comprehensive assessment of user-level bias. We evaluate models, including ChatGPT 4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash, on music and movie recommendations. FairEval's fairness metric, PAFS, achieves scores up to 0.9969 for ChatGPT 4o and 0.9997 for Gemini 1.5 Flash, with disparities reaching 34.79 percent. These results highlight the importance of robustness in prompt sensitivity and support more inclusive recommendation systems. | Chandan Kumar Sah, Xiaoli Lian, Tony Xu, Li Zhang |
| Unified Generative Search and Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05730) | Modern commercial platforms typically offer both search and recommendation functionalities to serve diverse user needs, making joint modeling of these tasks an appealing direction. While prior work has shown that integrating search and recommendation can be mutually beneficial, it also reveals a performance trade-off: enhancements in one task often come at the expense of the other. This challenge arises from their distinct information requirements: search emphasizes semantic relevance between queries and items, whereas recommendation depends more on collaborative signals among users and items. Effectively addressing this trade-off requires tackling two key problems: (1) integrating both semantic and collaborative signals into item representations, and (2) guiding the model to distinguish and adapt to the unique demands of search and recommendation. The emergence of generative retrieval with Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new possibilities. This paradigm encodes items as identifiers and frames both search and recommendation as sequential generation tasks, offering the flexibility to leverage multiple identifiers and task-specific prompts. In light of this, we introduce GenSAR, a unified generative framework for balanced search and recommendation. Our approach designs dual-purpose identifiers and tailored training strategies to incorporate complementary signals and align with task-specific objectives. Experiments on both public and commercial datasets demonstrate that GenSAR effectively reduces the trade-off and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both tasks. | Teng Shi, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Enyun Yu |

IGDMRec: Behavior Conditioned Item Graph Diffusion for Multimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19983,"Multimodal recommender systems (MRSs) are critical for various online platforms, offering users more accurate personalized recommendations by incorporating multimodal information of items. Structure-based MRSs have achieved state-of-the-art performance by constructing semantic item graphs, which explicitly model relationships between items based on modality feature similarity. However, such semantic item graphs are often noisy due to 1) inherent noise in multimodal information and 2) misalignment between item semantics and user-item co-occurrence relationships, which introduces false links and leads to suboptimal recommendations. To address this challenge, we propose Item Graph Diffusion for Multimodal Recommendation (IGDMRec), a novel method that leverages a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to denoise the semantic item graph by integrating user behavioral information. Specifically, IGDMRec introduces a Behavior-conditioned Graph Diffusion (BGD) module, incorporating interaction data as conditioning information to guide the denoising of the semantic item graph. Additionally, a Conditional Denoising Network (CD-Net) is designed to implement the denoising process with manageable complexity. Finally, we propose a contrastive representation augmentation scheme that leverages both the denoised item graph and the original item graph to enhance item representations. \LL{Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of IGDMRec over competitive baselines, with robustness analysis validating its denoising capability and ablation studies verifying the effectiveness of its key components.","Ziyuan Guo, Jie Guo, Zhenghao Chen, Bin Song, Fei Richard Yu"
LLM-Assisted Abstract Screening with OLIVER: Evaluating Calibration and Single-Model vs. Actor-Critic Configurations in Literature Reviews,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20022,"Introduction: Recent work suggests large language models (LLMs) can accelerate screening, but prior evaluations focus on earlier LLMs, standardized Cochrane reviews, single-model setups, and accuracy as the primary metric, leaving generalizability, configuration effects, and calibration largely unexamined.
  Methods: We developed OLIVER (Optimized LLM-based Inclusion and Vetting Engine for Reviews), an open-source pipeline for LLM-assisted abstract screening. We evaluated multiple contemporary LLMs across two non-Cochrane systematic reviews and performance was assessed at both the full-text screening and final inclusion stages using accuracy, AUC, and calibration metrics. We further tested an actor-critic screening framework combining two lightweight models under three aggregation rules.
  Results: Across individual models, performance varied widely. In the smaller Review 1 (821 abstracts, 63 final includes), several models achieved high sensitivity for final includes but at the cost of substantial false positives and poor calibration. In the larger Review 2 (7741 abstracts, 71 final includes), most models were highly specific but struggled to recover true includes, with prompt design influencing recall. Calibration was consistently weak across single-model configurations despite high overall accuracy. Actor-critic screening improved discrimination and markedly reduced calibration error in both reviews, yielding higher AUCs.
  Discussion: LLMs may eventually accelerate abstract screening, but single-model performance is highly sensitive to review characteristics, prompting, and calibration is limited. An actor-critic framework improves classification quality and confidence reliability while remaining computationally efficient, enabling large-scale screening at low cost.","Kian Godhwani, David Benrimoh"
Generative Retrieval with Few-shot Indexing,https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02152,"Existing generative retrieval (GR) methods rely on training-based indexing, which fine-tunes a model to memorise associations between queries and the document identifiers (docids) of relevant documents. Training-based indexing suffers from high training costs, under-utilisation of pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs), and limited adaptability to dynamic document corpora. To address the issues, we propose a few-shot indexing-based GR framework (Few-Shot GR). It has a few-shot indexing process without any training, where we prompt an LLM to generate docids for all documents in a corpus, ultimately creating a docid bank for the entire corpus. During retrieval, we feed a query to the same LLM and constrain it to generate a docid within the docid bank created during indexing, and then map the generated docid back to its corresponding document. Moreover, we devise few-shot indexing with one-to-many mapping to further enhance Few-Shot GR. Experiments show that Few-Shot GR achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art GR methods requiring heavy training.","Arian Askari, Chuan Meng, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Zhaochun Ren, Evangelos Kanoulas, Suzan Verberne"

PoultryTalk: A Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Intelligent Poultry Management and Decision Support,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08995,"The Poultry industry plays a vital role in global food security, yet small- and medium-scale farmers frequently lack timely access to expert-level support for disease diagnosis, nutrition planning, and management decisions. With rising climate stress, unpredictable feed prices, and persistent disease threats, poultry producers often struggle to make quick, informed decisions. Therefore, there is a critical need for intelligent, data-driven systems that can deliver reliable, on-demand consultation. This paper presents PoultryTalk, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide real-time expert guidance through text and image-based interaction. PoultryTalk uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small and GPT-4o to provide smart, context-aware poultry management advice from text, images, or questions. System usability and performance were evaluated using 200 expert-verified queries and feedback from 34 participants who submitted 267 queries to the PoultryTalk prototype. The expert-verified benchmark queries confirmed strong technical performance, achieving a semantic similarity of 84.0% and an average response latency of 3.6 seconds. Compared with OpenAI's GPT-4o, PoultryTalk delivered more accurate and reliable information related to poultry. Based on participants' evaluations, PoultryTalk achieved a response accuracy of 89.9%, with about 9.1% of responses rated as incorrect. A post-use survey indicated high user satisfaction: 95.6% of participants reported that the chatbot provided ""always correct"" and ""mostly correct"" answers. 82.6% indicated they would recommend the tool, and 17.4% responded ""maybe."" These results collectively demonstrate that PoultryTalk not only delivers accurate, contextually relevant information but also demonstrates strong user acceptance and scalability potential.","Kapalik Khanal, Biswash Khatiwada, Stephen Afrifa, Ranjan Sapkota, Sanjay Shah, Frank Bai, Ramesh Bahadur Bist"
Improving Topic Relevance Model by Mix-structured Summarization and LLM-based Data Augmentation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02616,"Topic relevance between query and document is a very important part of social search, which can evaluate the degree of matching between document and user's requirement. In most social search scenarios such as Dianping, modeling search relevance always faces two challenges. One is that many documents in social search are very long and have much redundant information. The other is that the training data for search relevance model is difficult to get, especially for multi-classification relevance model. To tackle above two problems, we first take query concatenated with the query-based summary and the document summary without query as the input of topic relevance model, which can help model learn the relevance degree between query and the core topic of document. Then, we utilize the language understanding and generation abilities of large language model (LLM) to rewrite and generate query from queries and documents in existing training data, which can construct new query-document pairs as training data. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests show that the proposed approaches effectively improve the performance of relevance modeling.","Yizhu Liu, Ran Tao, Shengyu Guo, Yifan Yang"
MemoryBench: A Benchmark for Memory and Continual Learning in LLM Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17281,"Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.","Qingyao Ai, Yichen Tang, Changyue Wang, Jianming Long, Weihang Su, Yiqun Liu"

| PATFinger: Prompt-Adapted Transferable Fingerprinting against Unauthorized Multimodal Dataset Usage | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11509](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11509) | The multimodal datasets can be leveraged to pre-train large-scale vision-language models by providing cross-modal semantics. Current endeavors for determining the usage of datasets mainly focus on single-modal dataset ownership verification through intrusive methods and non-intrusive techniques, while cross-modal approaches remain under-explored. Intrusive methods can adapt to multimodal datasets but degrade model accuracy, while non-intrusive methods rely on label-driven decision boundaries that fail to guarantee stable behaviors for verification. To address these issues, we propose a novel prompt-adapted transferable fingerprinting scheme from a training-free perspective, called PATFinger, which incorporates the global optimal perturbation (GOP) and the adaptive prompts to capture dataset-specific distribution characteristics. Our scheme utilizes inherent dataset attributes as fingerprints instead of compelling the model to learn triggers. The GOP is derived from the sample distribution to maximize embedding drifts between different modalities. Subsequently, our PATFinger re-aligns the adaptive prompt with GOP samples to capture the cross-modal interactions on the carefully crafted surrogate model. This allows the dataset owner to check the usage of datasets by observing specific prediction behaviors linked to the PATFinger during retrieval queries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme against unauthorized multimodal dataset usage on various cross-modal retrieval architectures by 30% over state-of-the-art baselines. | Wenyi Zhang, Ju Jia, Xiaojun Jia, Yihao Huang, Xinfeng Li, Cong Wu, Lina Wang |
| Improving LLM Interpretability and Performance via Guided Embedding Refinement for Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11658](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11658) | The fast development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers growing opportunities to further improve sequential recommendation systems. Yet for some practitioners, integrating LLMs to their existing base recommendation systems raises questions about model interpretability, transparency and related safety. To partly alleviate challenges from these questions, we propose guided embedding refinement, a method that carries out a guided and interpretable usage of LLM to enhance the embeddings associated with the base recommendation system. Instead of directly using LLMs as the backbone of sequential recommendation systems, we utilize them as auxiliary tools to emulate the sales logic of recommendation and generate guided embeddings that capture domain-relevant semantic information on interpretable attributes. Benefiting from the strong generalization capabilities of the guided embedding, we construct refined embedding by using the guided embedding and reduced-dimension version of the base embedding. We then integrate the refined embedding into the recommendation module for training and inference. A range of numerical experiments demonstrate that guided embedding is adaptable to various given existing base embedding models, and generalizes well across different recommendation tasks. The numerical results show that the refined embedding not only improves recommendation performance, achieving approximately $10\%$ to $50\%$ gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Recall rate, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), but also enhances interpretability, as evidenced by case studies. | Nanshan Jia, Chenfei Yuan, Yuhang Wu, Zeyu Zheng |
| Rethinking LLM-Based Recommendations: A Query Generation-Based, Training-Free Approach | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11889](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11889) | Existing large language model LLM-based recommendation methods face several challenges, including inefficiency in handling large candidate pools, sensitivity to item order within prompts ("lost in the middle" phenomenon) poor scalability, and unrealistic evaluation due to random negative sampling. To address these issues, we propose a Query-to-Recommendation approach that leverages LLMs to generate personalized queries for retrieving relevant items from the entire candidate pool, eliminating the need for candidate pre-selection. This method can be integrated into an ID-based recommendation system without additional training, enhances recommendation performance and diversity through LLMs' world knowledge, and performs well even for less popular item groups. Experiments on three datasets show up to 57 percent improvement, with an average gain of 31 percent, demonstrating strong zero-shot performance and further gains when ensembled with existing models. | Donghee Han, Hwanjun Song, Mun Yong Yi |
| Generative Recommendation with Continuous-Token Diffusion | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12007) | In recent years, there has been a significant trend toward using large language model (LLM)-based recommender systems (RecSys). Current research primarily focuses on representing complex user-item interactions within a discrete space to align with the inherent discrete nature of language models. However, this approach faces limitations due to its discrete nature: (i) information is often compressed during discretization; (ii) the tokenization and generation for the vast number of users and items in real-world scenarios are constrained by a limited vocabulary. Embracing continuous data presents a promising alternative to enhance expressive capabilities, though this approach is still in its early stages. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, DeftRec, which incorporates \textbf{de}noising di\textbf{f}fusion models to enable LLM-based RecSys to seamlessly support continuous \textbf{t}oken as input and target. First, we introduce a robust tokenizer with a masking operation and an additive K-way architecture to index users and items, capturing their complex collaborative relationships into continuous tokens. Crucially, we develop a denoising diffusion model to process user preferences within continuous domains by conditioning on reasoning content from pre-trained large language model. During the denoising process, we reformulate the objective to include negative interactions, building a comprehensive understanding of user preferences for effective and accurate recommendation generation. Finally, given a continuous token as output, recommendations can be easily generated through score-based retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, showing that DeftRec surpasses competitive benchmarks, including both traditional and emerging LLM-based RecSys. | Haohao Qu, Wenqi Fan, Shanru Lin |
| From Conceptual Data Models to Multimodal Representation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11459](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11459) | 1) Introduction and Conceptual Framework: This document explores the concept of information design by dividing it into two major practices: defining the meaning of a corpus of textual data and its visual or multimodal representation. It draws on expertise in enriching textual corpora, particularly audiovisual ones, and transforming them into multiple narrative formats. The text highlights a crucial distinction between the semantic content of a domain and the modalities of its graphic expression, illustrating this approach with concepts rooted in structural semiotics and linguistics traditions.
  2) Modeling and Conceptual Design:  The article emphasizes the importance of semantic modeling, often achieved through conceptual networks or graphs. These tools enable the structuring of knowledge within a domain by accounting for relationships between concepts, contexts of use, and specific objectives. Stockinger also highlights the constraints and challenges involved in creating dynamic and adaptable models, integrating elements such as thesauri or interoperable ontologies to facilitate the analysis and publication of complex corpora.
  3) Applications and Multimodal Visualization:  The text concludes by examining the practical application of these models in work environments like OKAPI, developed to analyze, publish, and reuse audiovisual data. It also discusses innovative approaches such as visual storytelling and document reengineering, which involve transforming existing content into new resources tailored to various contexts. These methods emphasize interoperability, flexibility, and the intelligence of communication systems, paving the way for richer and more collaborative use of digital data. The content of this document was presented during the "Semiotics of Information Design" Day organized by Anne Beyaert-Geslin of the University of Bordeaux Montaigne (MICA laboratory) on June 21, 2018, in Bordeaux. | Peter Stockinger (PLIDAM, ESCOM) |

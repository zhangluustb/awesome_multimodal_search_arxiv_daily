| Forecasting Clicks in Digital Advertising: Multimodal Inputs and Interpretable Outputs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09683](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09683) | Forecasting click volume is a key task in digital advertising, influencing both revenue and campaign strategy. Traditional time series models rely solely on numerical data, often overlooking rich contextual information embedded in textual elements, such as keyword updates. We present a multimodal forecasting framework that combines click data with textual logs from real-world ad campaigns and generates human-interpretable explanations alongside numeric predictions. Reinforcement learning is used to improve comprehension of textual information and enhance fusion of modalities. Experiments on a large-scale industry dataset show that our method outperforms baselines in both accuracy and reasoning quality. | Briti Gangopadhyay, Zhao Wang, Shingo Takamatsu |
| TalkPlayData 2: An Agentic Synthetic Data Pipeline for Multimodal Conversational Music Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09685](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09685) | We present TalkPlayData 2, a synthetic dataset for multimodal conversational music recommendation generated by an agentic data pipeline. In TalkPlayData 2 pipeline, multiple large language model (LLM) agents are created under various roles with specialized prompts and access to different parts of information, and the chat data is acquired by logging the conversation between the Listener LLM and the Recsys LLM. To cover various conversation scenarios, for each conversation, the Listener LLM is conditioned on a finetuned conversation goal. Finally, all the LLMs are multimodal with audio and images, allowing a simulation of multimodal recommendation and conversation. In the LLM-as-a-judge and subjective evaluation experiments, TalkPlayData 2 achieved the proposed goal in various aspects related to training a generative recommendation model for music. TalkPlayData 2 and its generation code are open-sourced at https://talkpl.ai/talkplaydata2.html. | Keunwoo Choi, Seungheon Doh, Juhan Nam |
| Powering Job Search at Scale: LLM-Enhanced Query Understanding in Job Matching Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09690](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09690) | Query understanding is essential in modern relevance systems, where user queries are often short, ambiguous, and highly context-dependent. Traditional approaches often rely on multiple task-specific Named Entity Recognition models to extract structured facets as seen in job search applications. However, this fragmented architecture is brittle, expensive to maintain, and slow to adapt to evolving taxonomies and language patterns. In this paper, we introduce a unified query understanding framework powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), designed to address these limitations. Our approach jointly models the user query and contextual signals such as profile attributes to generate structured interpretations that drive more accurate and personalized recommendations. The framework improves relevance quality in online A/B testing while significantly reducing system complexity and operational overhead. The results demonstrate that our solution provides a scalable and adaptable foundation for query understanding in dynamic web applications. | Ping Liu, Jianqiang Shen, Qianqi Shen, Chunnan Yao, Kevin Kao, Dan Xu, Rajat Arora, Baofen Zheng, Caleb Johnson, Liangjie Hong, Jingwei Wu, Wenjing Zhang |
| Efficient and Effective Adaptation of Multimodal Foundation Models in Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02992](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02992) | Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have revolutionized sequential recommender systems through advanced representation learning. While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We release our code at https://github.com/GAIR-Lab/IISAN. | Junchen Fu, Xuri Ge, Xin Xin, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Ioannis Arapakis, Kaiwen Zheng, Yongxin Ni, Joemon M. Jose |
| OMGM: Orchestrate Multiple Granularities and Modalities for Efficient Multimodal Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07879](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07879) | Vision-language retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an effective approach for tackling Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), which requires external knowledge beyond the visual content presented in images. The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems. | Wei Yang, Jingjing Fu, Rui Wang, Jinyu Wang, Lei Song, Jiang Bian |
| Privacy Risks of LLM-Empowered Recommender Systems: An Inversion Attack Perspective | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03703](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03703) | The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65 percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87 percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems. | Yubo Wang, Min Tang, Nuo Shen, Shujie Cui, Weiqing Wang |
| Are Multimodal Embeddings Truly Beneficial for Recommendation? A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399) | Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the MMRec community. We will release our code and datasets to facilitate future research. | Yu Ye, Junchen Fu, Yu Song, Kaiwen Zheng, Joemon M. Jose |

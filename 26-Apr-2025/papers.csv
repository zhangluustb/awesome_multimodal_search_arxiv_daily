Adaptive Orchestration of Modular Generative Information Access Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17454,"Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven the emergence of complex new systems to provide access to information, that we will collectively refer to as modular generative information access (GenIA) systems. They integrate a broad and evolving range of specialized components, including LLMs, retrieval models, and a heterogeneous set of sources and tools. While modularity offers flexibility, it also raises critical challenges: How can we systematically characterize the space of possible modules and their interactions? How can we automate and optimize interactions among these heterogeneous components? And, how do we enable this modular system to dynamically adapt to varying user query requirements and evolving module capabilities? In this perspective paper, we argue that the architecture of future modular generative information access systems will not just assemble powerful components, but enable a self-organizing system through real-time adaptive orchestration -- where components' interactions are dynamically configured for each user input, maximizing information relevance while minimizing computational overhead. We give provisional answers to the questions raised above with a roadmap that depicts the key principles and methods for designing such an adaptive modular system. We identify pressing challenges, and propose avenues for addressing them in the years ahead. This perspective urges the IR community to rethink modular system designs for developing adaptive, self-optimizing, and future-ready architectures that evolve alongside their rapidly advancing underlying technologies.","Mohanna Hoveyda, Harrie Oosterhuis, Arjen P. de Vries, Maarten de Rijke, Faegheh Hasibi"
Replication and Exploration of Generative Retrieval over Dynamic Corpora,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17519,"Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a promising paradigm in information retrieval (IR). However, most existing GR models are developed and evaluated using a static document collection, and their performance in dynamic corpora where document collections evolve continuously is rarely studied. In this paper, we first reproduce and systematically evaluate various representative GR approaches over dynamic corpora. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing GR models with \textit{text-based} docids show superior generalization to unseen documents. We observe that the more fine-grained the docid design in the GR model, the better its performance over dynamic corpora, surpassing BM25 and even being comparable to dense retrieval methods. While GR models with \textit{numeric-based} docids show high efficiency, their performance drops significantly over dynamic corpora. Furthermore, our experiments find that the underperformance of numeric-based docids is partly due to their excessive tendency toward the initial document set, which likely results from overfitting on the training set. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the best-performing GR methods. We identify three critical advantages of text-based docids in dynamic corpora: (i) Semantic alignment with language models' pretrained knowledge, (ii) Fine-grained docid design, and (iii) High lexical diversity. Building on these insights, we finally propose a novel multi-docid design that leverages both the efficiency of numeric-based docids and the effectiveness of text-based docids, achieving improved performance in dynamic corpus without requiring additional retraining. Our work offers empirical evidence for advancing GR methods over dynamic corpora and paves the way for developing more generalized yet efficient GR models in real-world search engines.","Zhen Zhang, Xinyu Ma, Weiwei Sun, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Maarten de Rijke, Zhaochun Ren"
Quadratic Interest Network for Multimodal Click-Through Rate Prediction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17699,"Multimodal click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a key technique in industrial recommender systems. It leverages heterogeneous modalities such as text, images, and behavioral logs to capture high-order feature interactions between users and items, thereby enhancing the system's understanding of user interests and its ability to predict click behavior. The primary challenge in this field lies in effectively utilizing the rich semantic information from multiple modalities while satisfying the low-latency requirements of online inference in real-world applications. To foster progress in this area, the Multimodal CTR Prediction Challenge Track of the WWW 2025 EReL@MIR Workshop formulates the problem into two tasks: (1) Task 1 of Multimodal Item Embedding: this task aims to explore multimodal information extraction and item representation learning methods that enhance recommendation tasks; and (2) Task 2 of Multimodal CTR Prediction: this task aims to explore what multimodal recommendation model can effectively leverage multimodal embedding features and achieve better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model for Task 2, named Quadratic Interest Network (QIN) for Multimodal CTR Prediction. Specifically, QIN employs adaptive sparse target attention to extract multimodal user behavior features, and leverages Quadratic Neural Networks to capture high-order feature interactions. As a result, QIN achieved an AUC of 0.9798 on the leaderboard and ranked second in the competition. The model code, training logs, hyperparameter configurations, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/salmon1802/QIN.","Honghao Li, Hanwei Li, Jing Zhang, Yi Zhang, Ziniu Yu, Lei Sang, Yiwen Zhang"
DataScout: Automatic Data Fact Retrieval for Statement Augmentation with an LLM-Based Agent,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17334,"A data story typically integrates data facts from multiple perspectives and stances to construct a comprehensive and objective narrative. However, retrieving these facts demands time for data search and challenges the creator's analytical skills. In this work, we introduce DataScout, an interactive system that automatically performs reasoning and stance-based data facts retrieval to augment the user's statement. Particularly, DataScout leverages an LLM-based agent to construct a retrieval tree, enabling collaborative control of its expansion between users and the agent. The interface visualizes the retrieval tree as a mind map that eases users to intuitively steer the retrieval direction and effectively engage in reasoning and analysis. We evaluate the proposed system through case studies and in-depth expert interviews. Our evaluation demonstrates that DataScout can effectively retrieve multifaceted data facts from different stances, helping users verify their statements and enhance the credibility of their stories.","Chuer Chen, Yuqi Liu, Danqing Shi, Shixiong Cao, Nan Cao"
jina-clip-v2: Multilingual Multimodal Embeddings for Text and Images,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08802,"Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely used for crossmodal information retrieval and multimodal understanding tasks. However, CLIP models are mainly optimized for crossmodal vision-language tasks and underperform in single-mode text tasks. Moreover, these models are often trained on English datasets and therefore lack multilingual understanding. Additionally, from a visual understanding perspective, previous CLIP-based models exhibit insufficient understanding of visually rich documents. In this work, we propose jina-clip-v2, a contrastive vision-language model trained on text pairs, triplets and image-text pairs via a multi-task and multi-stage contrastive learning paradigm in order to support both text-only and crossmodal tasks. We employ a multilingual text encoder and expand the training dataset to include multilingual texts from 29 non-English languages, including Hindi, Chinese, German, French, and others, as well as images of visually rich documents. We evaluate the model's performance and show that jina-clip-v2 achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-based models in zero-shot text-only retrieval, semantic textual similarity, and crossmodal retrieval tasks in both English and multilingual settings. jina-clip-v2 also provides for flexibility in embedding dimensionality, enabling users to select the granularity of the representations. jina-clip-v2 is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/jinaai/jina-clip-v2.","Andreas Koukounas, Georgios Mastrapas, Sedigheh Eslami, Bo Wang, Mohammad Kalim Akram, Michael G\""unther, Isabelle Mohr, Saba Sturua, Nan Wang, Han Xiao"

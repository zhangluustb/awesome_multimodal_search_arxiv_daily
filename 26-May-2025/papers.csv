DailyQA: A Benchmark to Evaluate Web Retrieval Augmented LLMs Based on Capturing Real-World Changes,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17162,"We propose DailyQA, an automatically updated dynamic dataset that updates questions weekly and contains answers to questions on any given date. DailyQA utilizes daily updates from Wikipedia revision logs to implement a fully automated pipeline of data filtering, query generation synthesis, quality checking, answer extraction, and query classification. The benchmark requires large language models (LLMs) to process and answer questions involving fast-changing factual data and covering multiple domains. We evaluate several open-source and closed-source LLMs using different RAG pipelines with web search augmentation. We compare the ability of different models to process time-sensitive web information and find that rerank of web retrieval results is critical. Our results indicate that LLMs still face significant challenges in handling frequently updated information, suggesting that DailyQA benchmarking provides valuable insights into the direction of progress for LLMs and RAG systems.","Jiehan Cheng, Zhicheng Dou"
EGA: A Unified End-to-End Generative Framework for Industrial Advertising Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17549,"Online industrial advertising system is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of multi-stage cascaded architectures, which filter out high-potential candidates early and fragment business decision logic across independent modules. Although recent advances in generative recommendation offer end-to-end solutions, they fall short of practical advertising requirements, lacking explicit modeling of bidding, creative selection, allocation mechanism, and payment computation that are essential for real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose End-to-end Generative Advertising (EGA), a first unified generative framework that seamlessly integrates user interests modeling, POI and creative generation, position allocation, and payment optimization within a single model. EGA leverages hierarchical tokenization and multi-token prediction to jointly generate candidate POI and creative contents, while a permutation-aware reward model and token-level bidding strategy ensure alignment with both user experiences and advertiser business objectives. Meanwhile, we decouple allocation from payment via a dedicated POI-level payment network with differentiable ex-post regret minimization, guaranteeing incentive compatibility approximately. Extensive offline and large-scale online experiments on real-world advertising systems demonstrate its effectiveness and practical advantages over traditional cascading architectures, highlighting its potential as one of the industry's pioneering end-to-end generative advertising solutions.","Zuowu Zheng, Ze Wang, Fan Yang, Jiangke Fan, Teng Zhang, Xingxing Wang"
VLM-KG: Multimodal Radiology Knowledge Graph Generation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17042,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation, excelling at instruction following and structured output generation. Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in radiology, serving as valuable sources of factual information and enhancing various downstream tasks. However, generating radiology-specific knowledge graphs presents significant challenges due to the specialized language of radiology reports and the limited availability of domain-specific data. Existing solutions are predominantly unimodal, meaning they generate knowledge graphs only from radiology reports while excluding radiographic images. Additionally, they struggle with long-form radiology data due to limited context length. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal VLM-based framework for knowledge graph generation in radiology. Our approach outperforms previous methods and introduces the first multimodal solution for radiology knowledge graph generation.","Abdullah Abdullah, Seong Tae Kim"
NEXT-EVAL: Next Evaluation of Traditional and LLM Web Data Record Extraction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17125,"Effective evaluation of web data record extraction methods is crucial, yet hampered by static, domain-specific benchmarks and opaque scoring practices. This makes fair comparison between traditional algorithmic techniques, which rely on structural heuristics, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches, offering zero-shot extraction across diverse layouts, particularly challenging. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a concrete evaluation framework. Our framework systematically generates evaluation datasets from arbitrary MHTML snapshots, annotates XPath-based supervision labels, and employs structure-aware metrics for consistent scoring, specifically preventing text hallucination and allowing only for the assessment of positional hallucination. It also incorporates preprocessing strategies to optimize input for LLMs while preserving DOM semantics: HTML slimming, Hierarchical JSON, and Flat JSON. Additionally, we created a publicly available synthetic dataset by transforming DOM structures and modifying content. We benchmark deterministic heuristic algorithms and off-the-shelf LLMs across these multiple input formats. Our benchmarking shows that Flat JSON input enables LLMs to achieve superior extraction accuracy (F1 score of 0.9567) and minimal hallucination compared to other input formats like Slimmed HTML and Hierarchical JSON. We establish a standardized foundation for rigorous benchmarking, paving the way for the next principled advancements in web data record extraction.","Soyeon Kim, Namhee Kim, Yeonwoo Jeong"
Resolving Conflicting Evidence in Automated Fact-Checking: A Study on Retrieval-Augmented LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17762,"Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval mechanisms have demonstrated significant potential in fact-checking tasks by integrating external knowledge. However, their reliability decreases when confronted with conflicting evidence from sources of varying credibility. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models for fact-checking in the presence of conflicting evidence. To support this study, we introduce \textbf{CONFACT} (\textbf{Con}flicting Evidence for \textbf{Fact}-Checking) (Dataset available at https://github.com/zoeyyes/CONFACT), a novel dataset comprising questions paired with conflicting information from various sources. Extensive experiments reveal critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art RAG methods, particularly in resolving conflicts stemming from differences in media source credibility. To address these challenges, we investigate strategies to integrate media background information into both the retrieval and generation stages. Our results show that effectively incorporating source credibility significantly enhances the ability of RAG models to resolve conflicting evidence and improve fact-checking performance.","Ziyu Ge, Yuhao Wu, Daniel Wai Kit Chin, Roy Ka-Wei Lee, Rui Cao"
User Feedback Alignment for LLM-powered Exploration in Large-scale Recommendation Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05522,"Exploration, the act of broadening user experiences beyond their established preferences, is challenging in large-scale recommendation systems due to feedback loops and limited signals on user exploration patterns. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential solutions by leveraging their world knowledge to recommend novel content outside these loops. A key challenge is aligning LLMs with user preferences while preserving their knowledge and reasoning. To enhance planning for new user interests using LLMs, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines hierarchical planning with LLM inference-time scaling. This method aims to improve recommendation relevancy without compromising novelty. We decouple novelty and user-alignment, training separate LLMs for each objective. We then scale up the novelty-focused LLM's inference and select the best-of-n predictions using the user-aligned LLM. Live experiments demonstrate efficacy, showing significant gains in both user satisfaction (measured by watch activity and active user counts) and exploration diversity.","Jianling Wang, Yifan Liu, Yinghao Sun, Xuejian Ma, Yueqi Wang, He Ma, Zhengyang Su, Minmin Chen, Mingyan Gao, Onkar Dalal, Ed H.

StealthRank: LLM Ranking Manipulation via Stealthy Prompt Optimization,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05804,"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into information retrieval systems introduces new attack surfaces, particularly for adversarial ranking manipulations. We present $\textbf{StealthRank}$, a novel adversarial attack method that manipulates LLM-driven ranking systems while maintaining textual fluency and stealth. Unlike existing methods that often introduce detectable anomalies, StealthRank employs an energy-based optimization framework combined with Langevin dynamics to generate StealthRank Prompts (SRPs)-adversarial text sequences embedded within item or document descriptions that subtly yet effectively influence LLM ranking mechanisms. We evaluate StealthRank across multiple LLMs, demonstrating its ability to covertly boost the ranking of target items while avoiding explicit manipulation traces. Our results show that StealthRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial ranking baselines in both effectiveness and stealth, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in LLM-driven ranking systems. Our code is publicly available at $\href{https://github.com/Tangyiming205069/controllable-seo}{here}$.","Yiming Tang, Yi Fan, Chenxiao Yu, Tiankai Yang, Yue Zhao, Xiyang Hu"
OpenTCM: A GraphRAG-Empowered LLM-based System for Traditional Chinese Medicine Knowledge Retrieval and Diagnosis,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20118,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a rich repository of ancient medical knowledge that continues to play an important role in modern healthcare. Due to the complexity and breadth of the TCM literature, the integration of AI technologies is critical for its modernization and broader accessibility. However, this integration poses considerable challenges, including the interpretation of obscure classical Chinese texts and the modeling of intricate semantic relationships among TCM concepts. In this paper, we develop OpenTCM, an LLM-based system that combines a domain-specific TCM knowledge graph and Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). First, we extract more than 3.73 million classical Chinese characters from 68 gynecological books in the Chinese Medical Classics Database, with the help of TCM and gynecology experts. Second, we construct a comprehensive multi-relational knowledge graph comprising more than 48,000 entities and 152,000 interrelationships, using customized prompts and Chinese-oriented LLMs such as DeepSeek and Kimi to ensure high-fidelity semantic understanding. Last, we integrate OpenTCM with this knowledge graph, enabling high-fidelity ingredient knowledge retrieval and diagnostic question-answering without model fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our prompt design and model selection significantly improve knowledge graph quality, achieving a precision of 98. 55% and an F1 score of 99. 55%. In addition, OpenTCM achieves mean expert scores of 4.5 in ingredient information retrieval and 3.8 in diagnostic question-answering tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in real-world TCM use cases.","Jinglin He, Yunqi Guo, Lai Kwan Lam, Waikei Leung, Lixing He, Yuanan Jiang, Chi Chiu Wang, Guoliang Xing, Hongkai Chen"

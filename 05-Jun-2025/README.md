| Scaling Transformers for Discriminative Recommendation via Generative Pretraining | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03699](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03699) | Discriminative recommendation tasks, such as CTR (click-through rate) and CVR (conversion rate) prediction, play critical roles in the ranking stage of large-scale industrial recommender systems. However, training a discriminative model encounters a significant overfitting issue induced by data sparsity. Moreover, this overfitting issue worsens with larger models, causing them to underperform smaller ones. To address the overfitting issue and enhance model scalability, we propose a framework named GPSD (\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{P}retraining for \textbf{S}calable \textbf{D}iscriminative Recommendation), drawing inspiration from generative training, which exhibits no evident signs of overfitting. GPSD leverages the parameters learned from a pretrained generative model to initialize a discriminative model, and subsequently applies a sparse parameter freezing strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on both industrial-scale and publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior performance of GPSD. Moreover, it delivers remarkable improvements in online A/B tests. GPSD offers two primary advantages: 1) it substantially narrows the generalization gap in model training, resulting in better test performance; and 2) it leverages the scalability of Transformers, delivering consistent performance gains as models are scaled up. Specifically, we observe consistent performance improvements as the model dense parameters scale from 13K to 0.3B, closely adhering to power laws. These findings pave the way for unifying the architectures of recommendation models and language models, enabling the direct application of techniques well-established in large language models to recommendation models. | Chunqi Wang, Bingchao Wu, Zheng Chen, Lei Shen, Bing Wang, Xiaoyi Zeng |
| GORACS: Group-level Optimal Transport-guided Coreset Selection for LLM-based Recommender Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04015](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04015) | Although large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, the prohibitive computational costs for fine-tuning LLMs on entire datasets hinder their successful deployment in real-world scenarios. To develop affordable and effective LLM-based recommender systems, we focus on the task of coreset selection which identifies a small subset of fine-tuning data to optimize the test loss, thereby facilitating efficient LLMs' fine-tuning. Although there exist some intuitive solutions of subset selection, including distribution-based and importance-based approaches, they often lead to suboptimal performance due to the misalignment with downstream fine-tuning objectives or weak generalization ability caused by individual-level sample selection. To overcome these challenges, we propose GORACS, which is a novel Group-level Optimal tRAnsport-guided Coreset Selection framework for LLM-based recommender systems. GORACS is designed based on two key principles for coreset selection: 1) selecting the subsets that minimize the test loss to align with fine-tuning objectives, and 2) enhancing model generalization through group-level data selection. Corresponding to these two principles, GORACS has two key components: 1) a Proxy Optimization Objective (POO) leveraging optimal transport and gradient information to bound the intractable test loss, thus reducing computational costs by avoiding repeated LLM retraining, and 2) a two-stage Initialization-Then-Refinement Algorithm (ITRA) for efficient group-level selection. Our extensive experiments across diverse recommendation datasets and tasks validate that GORACS significantly reduces fine-tuning costs of LLMs while achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines and full data training.

| A Generative Adaptive Replay Continual Learning Model for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04083](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04083) | Recent Continual Learning (CL)-based Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) methods focus on significantly reducing computational cost and mitigating catastrophic forgetting caused by fine-tuning models with new data. However, existing CL-based TKGR methods still face two key limitations: (1) They usually one-sidedly reorganize individual historical facts, while overlooking the historical context essential for accurately understanding the historical semantics of these facts; (2) They preserve historical knowledge by simply replaying historical facts, while ignoring the potential conflicts between historical and emerging facts. In this paper, we propose a Deep Generative Adaptive Replay (DGAR) method, which can generate and adaptively replay historical entity distribution representations from the whole historical context. To address the first challenge, historical context prompts as sampling units are built to preserve the whole historical context information. To overcome the second challenge, a pre-trained diffusion model is adopted to generate the historical distribution. During the generation process, the common features between the historical and current distributions are enhanced under the guidance of the TKGR model. In addition, a layer-by-layer adaptive replay mechanism is designed to effectively integrate historical and current distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGAR significantly outperforms baselines in reasoning and mitigating forgetting. | Zhiyu Zhang, Wei Chen, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan |
| DistRAG: Towards Distance-Based Spatial Reasoning in LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03424](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03424) | Many real world tasks where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used require spatial reasoning, like Point of Interest (POI) recommendation and itinerary planning. However, on their own LLMs lack reliable spatial reasoning capabilities, especially about distances. To address this problem, we develop a novel approach, DistRAG, that enables an LLM to retrieve relevant spatial information not explicitly learned during training. Our method encodes the geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph and retrieves a context subgraph relevant to the question. Using this technique, our method enables an LLM to answer distance-based reasoning questions that it otherwise cannot answer. Given the vast array of possible places an LLM could be asked about, DistRAG offers a flexible first step towards providing a rudimentary `world model' to complement the linguistic knowledge held in LLMs. | Nicole R Schneider, Nandini Ramachandran, Kent O'Sullivan, Hanan Samet |
| Understanding Mental Models of Generative Conversational Search and The Effect of Interface Transparency | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03807](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03807) | The experience and adoption of conversational search is tied to the accuracy and completeness of users' mental models -- their internal frameworks for understanding and predicting system behaviour. Thus, understanding these models can reveal areas for design interventions. Transparency is one such intervention which can improve system interpretability and enable mental model alignment. While past research has explored mental models of search engines, those of generative conversational search remain underexplored, even while the popularity of these systems soars. To address this, we conducted a study with 16 participants, who performed 4 search tasks using 4 conversational interfaces of varying transparency levels. Our analysis revealed that most user mental models were too abstract to support users in explaining individual search instances. These results suggest that 1) mental models may pose a barrier to appropriate trust in conversational search, and 2) hybrid web-conversational search is a promising novel direction for future search interface design. | Chadha Degachi, Samuel Kernan Freire, Evangelos Niforatos, Gerd Kortuem |
| Generative Recommender with End-to-End Learnable Item Tokenization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05546](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05546) | Generative recommendation systems have gained increasing attention as an innovative approach that directly generates item identifiers for recommendation tasks. Despite their potential, a major challenge is the effective construction of item identifiers that align well with recommender systems. Current approaches often treat item tokenization and generative recommendation training as separate processes, which can lead to suboptimal performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce ETEGRec, a novel End-To-End Generative Recommender that unifies item tokenization and generative recommendation into a cohesive framework. Built on a dual encoder-decoder architecture, ETEGRec consists of an item tokenizer and a generative recommender. To enable synergistic interaction between these components, we propose a recommendation-oriented alignment strategy, which includes two key optimization objectives: sequence-item alignment and preference-semantic alignment. These objectives tightly couple the learning processes of the item tokenizer and the generative recommender, fostering mutual enhancement. Additionally, we develop an alternating optimization technique to ensure stable and efficient end-to-end training of the entire framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to traditional sequential recommendation models and existing generative recommendation baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ETEGRec. | Enze Liu, Bowen Zheng, Cheng Ling, Lantao Hu, Han Li, Wayne Xin Zhao |
| What LLMs Miss in Recommendations: Bridging the Gap with Retrieval-Augmented Collaborative Signals | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20730) | User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders. | Shahrooz Pouryousef, Ali Montazeralghaem |
| MMM4Rec: A Transfer-Efficient Framework for Multi-modal Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02916](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02916) | Sequential Recommendation (SR) systems model user preferences by analyzing interaction histories. Although transferable multi-modal SR architectures demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional ID-based approaches, current methods incur substantial fine-tuning costs when adapting to new domains due to complex optimization requirements and negative transfer effects - a significant deployment bottleneck that hinders engineers from efficiently repurposing pre-trained models for novel application scenarios with minimal tuning overhead. We propose MMM4Rec (Multi-Modal Mamba for Sequential Recommendation), a novel multi-modal SR framework that incorporates a dedicated algebraic constraint mechanism for efficient transfer learning. By combining State Space Duality (SSD)'s temporal decay properties with a time-aware modeling design, our model dynamically prioritizes key modality information, overcoming limitations of Transformer-based approaches. The framework implements a constrained two-stage process: (1) sequence-level cross-modal alignment via shared projection matrices, followed by (2) temporal fusion using our newly designed Cross-SSD module and dual-channel Fourier adaptive filtering. This architecture maintains semantic consistency while suppressing noise propagation.MMM4Rec achieves rapid fine-tuning convergence with simple cross-entropy loss, significantly improving multi-modal recommendation accuracy while maintaining strong transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate MMM4Rec's state-of-the-art performance, achieving the maximum 31.78% NDCG@10 improvement over existing models and exhibiting 10 times faster average convergence speed when transferring to large-scale downstream datasets. | Hao Fan, Yanrong Hu, Kai Fang, Qingyang Liu, Hongjiu Liu |
| Hypothetical Documents or Knowledge Leakage? Rethinking LLM-based Query Expansion | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14175](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14175) | Query expansion methods powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness in zero-shot retrieval tasks. These methods assume that LLMs can generate hypothetical documents that, when incorporated into a query vector, enhance the retrieval of real evidence. However, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether knowledge leakage in benchmarks contributes to the observed performance gains. Using fact verification as a testbed, we analyze whether the generated documents contain information entailed by ground-truth evidence and assess their impact on performance. Our findings indicate that, on average, performance improvements consistently occurred for claims whose generated documents included sentences entailed by gold evidence. This suggests that knowledge leakage may be present in fact-verification benchmarks, potentially inflating the perceived performance of LLM-based query expansion methods. | Yejun Yoon, Jaeyoon Jung, Seunghyun Yoon, Kunwoo Park |

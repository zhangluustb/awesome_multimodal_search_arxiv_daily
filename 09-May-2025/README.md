| Memory Assisted LLM for Personalized Recommendation System | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03824](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03824) | Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in solving recommendation tasks. With proven capabilities in understanding user preferences, LLM personalization has emerged as a critical area for providing tailored responses to individuals. Current studies explore personalization through prompt design and fine-tuning, paving the way for further research in personalized LLMs. However, existing approaches are either costly and inefficient in capturing diverse user preferences or fail to account for timely updates to user history. To address these gaps, we propose the Memory-Assisted Personalized LLM (MAP). Through user interactions, we first create a history profile for each user, capturing their preferences, such as ratings for historical items. During recommendation, we extract relevant memory based on similarity, which is then incorporated into the prompts to enhance personalized recommendations. In our experiments, we evaluate MAP using a sequential rating prediction task under two scenarios: single domain, where memory and tasks are from the same category (e.g., movies), and cross-domain (e.g., memory from movies and recommendation tasks in books). The results show that MAP outperforms regular LLM-based recommenders that integrate user history directly through prompt design. Moreover, as user history grows, MAP's advantage increases in both scenarios, making it more suitable for addressing successive personalized user requests. | Jiarui Chen |
| An Adaptive Data-Resilient Multi-Modal Framework for Hierarchical Multi-Label Book Genre Identification | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03839](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03839) | Identifying the finer details of a book's genres enhances user experience by enabling efficient book discovery and personalized recommendations, ultimately improving reader engagement and satisfaction. It also provides valuable insights into market trends and consumer preferences, allowing publishers and marketers to make data-driven decisions regarding book production and marketing strategies. While traditional book genre classification methods primarily rely on review data or textual analysis, incorporating additional modalities, such as book covers, blurbs, and metadata, can offer richer context and improve prediction accuracy. However, the presence of incomplete or noisy information across these modalities presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces IMAGINE (Intelligent Multi-modal Adaptive Genre Identification NEtwork), a framework designed to address these complexities. IMAGINE extracts robust feature representations from multiple modalities and dynamically selects the most informative sources based on data availability. It employs a hierarchical classification strategy to capture genre relationships and remains adaptable to varying input conditions. Additionally, we curate a hierarchical genre classification dataset that structures genres into a well-defined taxonomy, accommodating the diverse nature of literary works. IMAGINE integrates information from multiple sources and assigns multiple genre labels to each book, ensuring a more comprehensive classification. A key feature of our framework is its resilience to incomplete data, enabling accurate predictions even when certain modalities, such as text, images, or metadata, are missing or incomplete. Experimental results show that IMAGINE outperformed existing baselines in genre classification accuracy, particularly in scenarios with insufficient modality-specific data. | Utsav Kumar Nareti, Soumi Chattopadhyay, Prolay Mallick, Suraj Kumar, Ayush Vikas Daga, Chandranath Adak, Adarsh Wase, Arjab Roy |
| Towards Large-scale Generative Ranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04180](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04180) | Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a promising paradigm in information retrieval. However, generative ranking systems are still understudied, particularly with respect to their effectiveness and feasibility in large-scale industrial settings. This paper investigates this topic at the ranking stage of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed, a recommender system that serves hundreds of millions of users. Specifically, we first examine how generative ranking outperforms current industrial recommenders. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we find that the primary improvement in effectiveness stems from the generative architecture, rather than the training paradigm. To facilitate efficient deployment of generative ranking, we introduce GenRank, a novel generative architecture for ranking. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution through online A/B experiments. The results show that GenRank achieves significant improvements in user satisfaction with nearly equivalent computational resources compared to the existing production system. | Yanhua Huang, Yuqi Chen, Xiong Cao, Rui Yang, Mingliang Qi, Yinghao Zhu, Qingchang Han, Yaowei Liu, Zhaoyu Liu, Xuefeng Yao, Yuting Jia, Leilei Ma, Yinqi Zhang, Taoyu Zhu, Liujie Zhang, Lei Chen, Weihang Chen, Min Zhu, Ruiwen Xu, Lei Zhang |
| To Judge or not to Judge: Using LLM Judgements for Advertiser Keyphrase Relevance at eBay | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04209) | E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics. | Soumik Dey, Hansi Wu, Binbin Li |
| LLM-based Bi-level Multi-interest Learning Framework for Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09410](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09410) | Sequential recommendation (SR) leverages users' dynamic preferences, with recent advances incorporating multi-interest learning to model diverse user interests. However, most multi-interest SR models rely on noisy, sparse implicit feedback, limiting recommendation accuracy. Large language models (LLMs) offer robust reasoning on low-quality data but face high computational costs and latency challenges for SR integration. We propose a novel LLM-based multi-interest SR framework combining implicit behavioral and explicit semantic perspectives. It includes two modules: the Implicit Behavioral Interest Module (IBIM), which learns from user behavior using a traditional SR model, and the Explicit Semantic Interest Module (ESIM), which uses clustering and prompt-engineered LLMs to extract semantic multi-interest representations from informative samples. Semantic insights from ESIM enhance IBIM's behavioral representations via modality alignment and semantic prediction tasks. During inference, only IBIM is used, ensuring efficient, LLM-free recommendations. Experiments on four real-world datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and practicality. | Shutong Qiao, Chen Gao, Wei Yuan, Yong Li, Hongzhi Yin |
| OAEI-LLM-T: A TBox Benchmark Dataset for Understanding Large Language Model Hallucinations in Ontology Matching | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21813) | Hallucinations are often inevitable in downstream tasks using large language models (LLMs). To tackle the substantial challenge of addressing hallucinations for LLM-based ontology matching (OM) systems, we introduce a new benchmark dataset called OAEI-LLM-T. The dataset evolves from the TBox (i.e. schema-matching) datasets in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), capturing hallucinations of different LLMs performing OM tasks. These OM-specific hallucinations are carefully classified into two primary categories and six sub-categories. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset in constructing the LLM leaderboard and fine-tuning foundational LLMs for LLM-based OM systems. | Zhangcheng Qiang |

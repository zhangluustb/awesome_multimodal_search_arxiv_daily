Factorized Transport Alignment for Multimodal and Multiview E-commerce Representation Learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18117,"The rapid growth of e-commerce requires robust multimodal representations that capture diverse signals from user-generated listings. Existing vision-language models (VLMs) typically align titles with primary images, i.e., single-view, but overlook non-primary images and auxiliary textual views that provide critical semantics in open marketplaces such as Etsy or Poshmark. To this end, we propose a framework that unifies multimodal and multi-view learning through Factorized Transport, a lightweight approximation of optimal transport, designed for scalability and deployment efficiency. During training, the method emphasizes primary views while stochastically sampling auxiliary ones, reducing training cost from quadratic in the number of views to constant per item. At inference, all views are fused into a single cached embedding, preserving the efficiency of two-tower retrieval with no additional online overhead. On an industrial dataset of 1M product listings and 0.3M interactions, our approach delivers consistent improvements in cross-view and query-to-item retrieval, achieving up to +7.9% Recall@500 over strong multimodal baselines. Overall, our framework bridges scalability with optimal transport-based learning, making multi-view pretraining practical for large-scale e-commerce search.","Xiwen Chen, Yen-Chieh Lien, Susan Liu, Mar\'ia Casta\~nos, Abolfazl Razi, Xiaoting Zhao, Congzhe Su"
Efficient Optimization of Hierarchical Identifiers for Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18434,"SEATER is a generative retrieval model that improves recommendation inference efficiency and retrieval quality by utilizing balanced tree-structured item identifiers and contrastive training objectives. We reproduce and validate SEATER's reported improvements in retrieval quality over strong baselines across all datasets from the original work, and extend the evaluation to Yambda, a large-scale music recommendation dataset. Our experiments verify SEATER's strong performance, but show that its tree construction step during training becomes a major bottleneck as the number of items grows. To address this, we implement and evaluate two alternative construction algorithms: a greedy method optimized for minimal build time, and a hybrid method that combines greedy clustering at high levels with more precise grouping at lower levels. The greedy method reduces tree construction time to less than 2% of the original with only a minor drop in quality on the dataset with the largest item collection. The hybrid method achieves retrieval quality on par with the original, and even improves on the largest dataset, while cutting construction time to just 5-8%. All data and code are publicly available for full reproducibility at https://github.com/joshrosie/re-seater.","Federica Valeau, Odysseas Boufalis, Polytimi Gkotsi, Joshua Rosenthal, David Vos"
Generative vector search to improve pathology foundation models across multimodal vision-language tasks,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19360,"Retrieval-augmented generation improves large language models by grounding outputs in external knowledge sources, reducing hallucinations and addressing knowledge cutoffs. However, standard embedding-based retrieval fails to capture the complexity of multi-concept queries, particularly in domains like biomedicine, where biological data are inherently high-dimensional. For example,omics datasets, and clinical reports simultaneously exhibit numerous molecular, cellular, and physiological features. We present Stochastic Latent Matching (STHLM), a generative vector search method that samples query-conditioned embeddings from text or image inputs to enhance retrieval performance. Analogous to how Chain-of-Thought reasoning enables language models to ""think longer"" on complex problems, STHLM allows retrieval systems to ""search wider"" through iterative sampling. STHLM demonstrates critical improvements over classical vector retrieval across diverse benchmarks, including scientific literature, clinical notes, and tissue images, boosting retrieval performance by 10-30% through test-time compute (trading latency for accuracy), while enabling up to a 10-fold compression of embedding dimensions.","Markus Ekvall, Ludvig Bergenstr{\aa}hle, Patrick Truong, Ben Murrell, Joakim Lundeberg"
Generative Retrieval with Few-shot Indexing,https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02152,"Existing generative retrieval (GR) methods rely on training-based indexing, which fine-tunes a model to memorise associations between queries and the document identifiers (docids) of relevant documents. Training-based indexing suffers from high training costs, under-utilisation of pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs), and limited adaptability to dynamic document corpora. To address the issues, we propose a few-shot indexing-based GR framework (Few-Shot GR). It has a few-shot indexing process without any training, where we prompt an LLM to generate docids for all documents in a corpus, ultimately creating a docid bank for the entire corpus. During retrieval, we feed a query to the same LLM and constrain it to generate a docid within the docid bank created during indexing, and then map the generated docid back to its corresponding document. Moreover, we devise few-shot indexing with one-to-many mapping to further enhance Few-Shot GR. Experiments show that Few-Shot GR achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art GR methods requiring heavy training.","Arian Askari, Chuan Meng, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Zhaochun Ren, Evangelos Kanoulas, Suzan Verberne"
Structured Spectral Reasoning for Frequency-Adaptive Multimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01372,"Multimodal recommendation aims to integrate collaborative signals with heterogeneous content such as visual and textual information, but remains challenged by modality-specific noise, semantic inconsistency, and unstable propagation over user-item graphs. These issues are often exacerbated by naive fusion or shallow modeling strategies, leading to degraded generalization and poor robustness. While recent work has explored the frequency domain as a lens to separate stable from noisy signals, most methods rely on static filtering or reweighting, lacking the ability to reason over spectral structure or adapt to modality-specific reliability. To address these challenges, we propose a Structured Spectral Reasoning (SSR) framework for frequency-aware multimodal recommendation. Our method follows a four-stage pipeline: (i) Decompose graph-based multimodal signals into spectral bands via graph-guided transformations to isolate semantic granularity; (ii) Modulate band-level reliability with spectral band masking, a training-time masking with a prediction-consistency objective that suppresses brittle frequency components; (iii) Fuse complementary frequency cues using hyperspectral reasoning with low-rank cross-band interaction; and (iv) Align modality-specific spectral features via contrastive regularization to promote semantic and structural consistency. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, particularly under sparse and cold-start settings. Additional analyses indicate that structured spectral modeling improves robustness and provides clearer diagnostics of how different bands contribute to performance.","Wei Yang, Rui Zhong, Yiqun Chen, Chi Lu, Peng Jiang"
WebATLAS: An LLM Agent with Experience-Driven Memory and Action Simulation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22732,"Large Language Model (LLM) web agents often struggle with long-horizon web navigation and web task completion in new websites, producing inefficient action sequences unless fine-tuned on environment-specific data. We show that experience-driven memory, combined with look-ahead action simulation, is sufficient for LLM agents to adapt to unseen web environments by remembering past failures and predicting the consequences of future actions. We introduce WebATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action Simulation), a memory-augmented LLM web agent that learns a lightweight internal model of the environment from interaction experience and performs hypothetical action rollouts before acting in the real world. WebATLAS builds a persistent cognitive map via curiosity-driven exploration, stores interaction outcomes as experience-based memory, and evaluates candidate actions in cognitive space using a planner--simulator--critic loop. This enables the agent to reuse past experience, avoid previously unsuccessful behaviors, and generate more efficient plans. We evaluate WebATLAS on the WebArena-Lite benchmark for autonomous web navigation and demonstrate a success rate of 63%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art at 53.9%. Unlike previous systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that experience-driven memory, look-ahead action simulation, and hierarchical replanning play complementary roles in enabling robust, training-free web agents.","Jiali Cheng, Anjishnu Kumar, Roshan Lal, Rishi Rajasekaran, Hani Ramezani, Omar Zia Khan, Oleg Rokhlenko, Sunny Chiu-Webster, Gang Hua, Hadi Amiri"
What-If Decision Support for Product Line Extension Using Conditional Deep Generative Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11646,"Product line extension is a strategically important managerial decision that requires anticipating how consumer segments and purchasing contexts may respond to hypothetical product designs that do not yet exist in the market. Such decisions are inherently uncertain because managers must infer future outcomes from historical purchase data without direct market observations. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a data-driven decision support framework that enables forward-looking what-if analysis based on historical transaction data. We introduce a Conditional Tabular Variational Autoencoder (CTVAE) that learns the conditional joint distribution of product attributes and consumer characteristics from large-scale tabular data. By conditioning the generative process on controllable design variables such as container type, volume, flavor, and calorie content, the proposed model generates synthetic consumer attribute distributions for hypothetical line-extended products. This enables systematic exploration of alternative design scenarios without costly market pretests. The framework is evaluated using home-scan panel data covering more than 20,000 consumers and 700 soft drink products. Empirical results show that the CTVAE outperforms existing tabular generative models in capturing conditional consumer attribute distributions. Simulation-based analyses further demonstrate that the generated synthetic data support knowledge-driven reasoning for assessing cannibalization risks and identifying potential target segments. These findings highlight the value of conditional deep generative models as core components of decision support systems for product line extension planning.","Yinxing Li, Tsukasa Ishigaki"

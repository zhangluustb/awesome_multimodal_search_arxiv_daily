| Optimizing Recommendations using Fine-Tuned LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06841](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06841) | As digital media platforms strive to meet evolving user expectations, delivering highly personalized and intuitive movies and media recommendations has become essential for attracting and retaining audiences. Traditional systems often rely on keyword-based search and recommendation techniques, which limit users to specific keywords and a combination of keywords. This paper proposes an approach that generates synthetic datasets by modeling real-world user interactions, creating complex chat-style data reflective of diverse preferences. This allows users to express more information with complex preferences, such as mood, plot details, and thematic elements, in addition to conventional criteria like genre, title, and actor-based searches. In today's search space, users cannot write queries like ``Looking for a fantasy movie featuring dire wolves, ideally set in a harsh frozen world with themes of loyalty and survival.''
  Building on these contributions, we evaluate synthetic datasets for diversity and effectiveness in training and benchmarking models, particularly in areas often absent from traditional datasets. This approach enhances personalization and accuracy by enabling expressive and natural user queries. It establishes a foundation for the next generation of conversational AI-driven search and recommendation systems in digital entertainment. | Prabhdeep Cheema, Erhan Guven |
| Web Page Classification using LLMs for Crawling Support | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06972) | A web crawler is a system designed to collect web pages, and efficient crawling of new pages requires appropriate algorithms. While website features such as XML sitemaps and the frequency of past page updates provide important clues for accessing new pages, their universal application across diverse conditions is challenging. In this study, we propose a method to efficiently collect new pages by classifying web pages into two types, "Index Pages" and "Content Pages," using a large language model (LLM), and leveraging the classification results to select index pages as starting points for accessing new pages. We construct a dataset with automatically annotated web page types and evaluate our approach from two perspectives: the page type classification performance and coverage of new pages. Experimental results demonstrate that the LLM-based method outperformed baseline methods in both evaluation metrics. | Yuichi Sasazawa, Yasuhiro Sogawa |
| A Generative Re-ranking Model for List-level Multi-objective Optimization at Taobao | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07197](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07197) | E-commerce recommendation systems aim to generate ordered lists of items for customers, optimizing multiple business objectives, such as clicks, conversions and Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). Traditional multi-objective optimization methods like formulas or Learning-to-rank (LTR) models take effect at item-level, neglecting dynamic user intent and contextual item interactions. List-level multi-objective optimization in the re-ranking stage can overcome this limitation, but most current re-ranking models focus more on accuracy improvement with context. In addition, re-ranking is faced with the challenges of time complexity and diversity. In light of this, we propose a novel end-to-end generative re-ranking model named Sequential Ordered Regression Transformer-Generator (SORT-Gen) for the less-studied list-level multi-objective optimization problem. Specifically, SORT-Gen is divided into two parts: 1)Sequential Ordered Regression Transformer innovatively uses Transformer and ordered regression to accurately estimate multi-objective values for variable-length sub-lists. 2)Mask-Driven Fast Generation Algorithm combines multi-objective candidate queues, efficient item selection and diversity mechanism into model inference, providing a fast online list generation method. Comprehensive online experiments demonstrate that SORT-Gen brings +4.13% CLCK and +8.10% GMV for Baiyibutie, a notable Mini-app of Taobao. Currently, SORT-Gen has been successfully deployed in multiple scenarios of Taobao App, serving for a vast number of users. | Yue Meng, Cheng Guo, Yi Cao, Tong Liu, Bo Zheng |
| Process-Supervised LLM Recommenders via Flow-guided Tuning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07377](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07377) | While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted for recommendation systems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), this approach amplifies popularity bias due to its likelihood maximization objective, compromising recommendation diversity and fairness. To address this, we present Flow-guided fine-tuning recommender (Flower), which replaces SFT with a Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) framework that enacts process supervision through token-level reward propagation. Flower's key innovation lies in decomposing item-level rewards into constituent token rewards, enabling direct alignment between token generation probabilities and their reward signals. This mechanism achieves three critical advancements: (1) popularity bias mitigation and fairness enhancement through empirical distribution matching, (2) preservation of diversity through GFlowNet's proportional sampling, and (3) flexible integration of personalized preferences via adaptable token rewards. Experiments demonstrate Flower's superior distribution-fitting capability and its significant advantages over traditional SFT in terms of accuracy, fairness, and diversity, highlighting its potential to improve LLM-based recommendation systems.

| Alleviating LLM-based Generative Retrieval Hallucination in Alipay Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21098](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21098) | Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains. | Yedan Shen, Kaixin Wu, Yuechen Ding, Jingyuan Wen, Hong Liu, Mingjie Zhong, Zhouhan Lin, Jia Xu, Linjian Mo |
| From Prompting to Alignment: A Generative Framework for Query Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10208](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10208) | In modern search systems, search engines often suggest relevant queries to users through various panels or components, helping refine their information needs. Traditionally, these recommendations heavily rely on historical search logs to build models, which suffer from cold-start or long-tail issues. Furthermore, tasks such as query suggestion, completion or clarification are studied separately by specific design, which lacks generalizability and hinders adaptation to novel applications. Despite recent attempts to explore the use of LLMs for query recommendation, these methods mainly rely on the inherent knowledge of LLMs or external sources like few-shot examples, retrieved documents, or knowledge bases, neglecting the importance of the calibration and alignment with user feedback, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these challenges, we first propose a general Generative Query Recommendation (GQR) framework that aligns LLM-based query generation with user preference. Specifically, we unify diverse query recommendation tasks by a universal prompt framework, leveraging the instruct-following capability of LLMs for effective generation. Secondly, we align LLMs with user feedback via presenting a CTR-alignment framework, which involves training a query-wise CTR predictor as a process reward model and employing list-wise preference alignment to maximize the click probability of the generated query list. Furthermore, recognizing the inconsistency between LLM knowledge and proactive search intents arising from the separation of user-initiated queries from models, we align LLMs with user initiative via retrieving co-occurrence queries as side information when historical logs are available. | Erxue Min, Hsiu-Yuan Huang, Min Yang, Xihong Yang, Xin Jia, Yunfang Wu, Hengyi Cai, Junfeng Wang, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin |

| Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20147](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20147) | Session-based recommendation (SBR) is mainly based on anonymous user interaction sequences to recommend the items that the next user is most likely to click. Currently, the most popular and high-performing SBR methods primarily leverage graph neural networks (GNNs), which model session sequences as graph-structured data to effectively capture user intent. However, most GNNs-based SBR methods primarily focus on modeling the ID sequence information of session sequences, while neglecting the rich semantic information embedded within them. This limitation significantly hampers model's ability to accurately infer users' true intention. To address above challenge, this paper proposes a novel SBR approach called Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (LLM-DMsRec). The method utilizes a pre-trained GNN model to select the top-k items as candidate item sets and designs prompts along with a large language model (LLM) to infer multi-semantic intents from these candidate items. Specifically, we propose an alignment mechanism that effectively integrates the semantic intent inferred by the LLM with the structural intent captured by GNNs. Extensive experiments conducted on the Beauty and ML-1M datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into GNNs framework, significantly enhancing its recommendation performance. | Shuo Zhang, Xiao Li, Jiayi Wu, Fan Yang, Xiang Li, Ming Gao |
| TADT-CSA: Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State Abstraction for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20327](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20327) | With the rapid advancement of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), generative recommendation has shown great potential in enhancing both the accuracy and semantic understanding of modern recommender systems. Compared to LLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied to sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory stitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high dimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in recommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and struggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State Abstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional Return-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that encourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential trend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into the DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations. Within this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization (TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to incorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction network and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to ensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current state and the transition information between adjacent states. Empirical results on both public datasets and an online recommendation system demonstrate the effectiveness of the TADT-CSA model and its superiority over baseline methods. | Xiang Gao, Tianyuan Liu, Yisha Li, Jingxin Liu, Lexi Gao, Xin Li, Haiyang Lu, Liyin Hong |
| Multi-Stage Verification-Centric Framework for Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-Modal RAG | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20136) | This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn (CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

| Heterogeneous User Modeling for LLM-based Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04626](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04626) | Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation has demonstrated notable success in various domains, showcasing their potential for open-domain recommendation. A key challenge to advancing open-domain recommendation lies in effectively modeling user preferences from users' heterogeneous behaviors across multiple domains. Existing approaches, including ID-based and semantic-based modeling, struggle with poor generalization, an inability to compress noisy interactions effectively, and the domain seesaw phenomenon. To address these challenges, we propose a Heterogeneous User Modeling (HUM) method, which incorporates a compression enhancer and a robustness enhancer for LLM-based recommendation. The compression enhancer uses a customized prompt to compress heterogeneous behaviors into a tailored token, while a masking mechanism enhances cross-domain knowledge extraction and understanding. The robustness enhancer introduces a domain importance score to mitigate the domain seesaw phenomenon by guiding domain optimization. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous datasets validate that HUM effectively models user heterogeneity by achieving both high efficacy and robustness, leading to superior performance in open-domain recommendation. | Honghui Bao, Wenjie Wang, Xinyu Lin, Fengbin Zhu, Teng Sun, Fuli Feng, Tat-Seng Chua |

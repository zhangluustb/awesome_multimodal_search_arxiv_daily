| Progressive Semantic Residual Quantization for Multimodal-Joint Interest Modeling in Music Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20359](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20359) | In music recommendation systems, multimodal interest learning is pivotal, which allows the model to capture nuanced preferences, including textual elements such as lyrics and various musical attributes such as different instruments and melodies. Recently, methods that incorporate multimodal content features through semantic IDs have achieved promising results. However, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: 1) intra-modal semantic degradation, where residual-based quantization processes gradually decouple discrete IDs from original content semantics, leading to semantic drift; and 2) inter-modal modeling gaps, where traditional fusion strategies either overlook modal-specific details or fail to capture cross-modal correlations, hindering comprehensive user interest modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal recommendation framework with two stages. In the first stage, our Progressive Semantic Residual Quantization (PSRQ) method generates modal-specific and modal-joint semantic IDs by explicitly preserving the prefix semantic feature. In the second stage, to model multimodal interest of users, a Multi-Codebook Cross-Attention (MCCA) network is designed to enable the model to simultaneously capture modal-specific interests and perceive cross-modal correlations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This framework has been deployed on one of China's largest music streaming platforms, and online A/B tests confirm significant improvements in commercial metrics, underscoring its practical value for industrial-scale recommendation systems. | Shijia Wang, Tianpei Ouyang, Qiang Xiao, Dongjing Wang, Yintao Ren, Songpei Xu, Da Guo, Chuanjiang Luo |
| Revealing Potential Biases in LLM-Based Recommender Systems in the Cold Start Setting | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20401) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining. We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis. | Alexandre Andre, Gauthier Roy, Eva Dyer, Kai Wang |
| SUMMA: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Advertisement Summarization | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20582](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20582) | Understanding multimodal video ads is crucial for improving query-ad matching and relevance ranking on short video platforms, enhancing advertising effectiveness and user experience. However, the effective utilization of multimodal information with high commercial value still largely constrained by reliance on highly compressed video embeddings-has long been inadequate. To address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts, generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5% increase in advertising revenue. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for condensing multimodal information into representative texts, effectively aligning visual ad content with user query intent in retrieval and recommendation scenarios. | Weitao Jia, Shuo Yin, Zhoufutu Wen, Han Wang, Zehui Dai, Kun Zhang, Zhenyu Li, Tao Zeng, Xiaohui Lv |
| Leveraging Generative Models for Real-Time Query-Driven Text Summarization in Large-Scale Web Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20559](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20559) | In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments, have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency, requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per second under 55~ms average latency per query. | Zeyu Xiong, Yixuan Nan, Li Gao, Hengzhu Tang, Shuaiqiang Wang, Junfeng Wang, Dawei Yin |
| GDLLM: A Global Distance-aware Modeling Approach Based on Large Language Models for Event Temporal Relation Extraction | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20828](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20828) | In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability. Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. | Jie Zhao, Wanting Ning, Yuxiao Fei, Yubo Feng, Lishuang Li |
| FindRec: Stein-Guided Entropic Flow for Multi-Modal Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04651](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04651) | Modern recommendation systems face significant challenges in processing multimodal sequential data, particularly in temporal dynamics modeling and information flow coordination. Traditional approaches struggle with distribution discrepancies between heterogeneous features and noise interference in multimodal signals. We propose \textbf{FindRec}~ (\textbf{F}lexible unified \textbf{in}formation \textbf{d}isentanglement for multi-modal sequential \textbf{Rec}ommendation), introducing a novel "information flow-control-output" paradigm. The framework features two key innovations: (1) A Stein kernel-based Integrated Information Coordination Module (IICM) that theoretically guarantees distribution consistency between multimodal features and ID streams, and (2) A cross-modal expert routing mechanism that adaptively filters and combines multimodal features based on their contextual relevance. Our approach leverages multi-head subspace decomposition for routing stability and RBF-Stein gradient for unbiased distribution alignment, enhanced by linear-complexity Mamba layers for efficient temporal modeling. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate FindRec's superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in handling long sequences and noisy multimodal inputs. Our framework achieves both improved recommendation accuracy and enhanced model interpretability through its modular design. The implementation code is available anonymously online for easy reproducibility~\footnote{https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/FindRec}. | Maolin Wang, Yutian Xiao, Binhao Wang, Sheng Zhang, Shanshan Ye, Wanyu Wang, Hongzhi Yin, Ruocheng Guo, Zenglin Xu |
| LLM-Based Agents for Competitive Landscape Mapping in Drug Asset Due Diligence | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16571](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16571) | In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis. | Alisa Vinogradova (Optic Inc), Vlad Vinogradov (Optic Inc), Dmitrii Radkevich (Optic Inc), Ilya Yasny (Optic Inc), Dmitry Kobyzev (Optic Inc), Ivan Izmailov (Optic Inc), Katsiaryna Yanchanka (Optic Inc), Roman Doronin (Optic Inc), Andrey Doronichev (Optic Inc) |

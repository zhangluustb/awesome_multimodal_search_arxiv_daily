| Rethinking LLM Parametric Knowledge as Post-retrieval Confidence for Dynamic Retrieval and Reranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06472](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06472) | Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses (hallucinations) when faced with questions beyond their knowledge scope. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by leveraging external knowledge, but a critical challenge remains: determining whether retrieved contexts effectively enhance the model`s ability to answer specific queries. This challenge underscores the importance of knowledge boundary awareness, which current methods-relying on discrete labels or limited signals-fail to address adequately, as they overlook the rich information in LLMs` continuous internal hidden states. To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval knowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model based on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts enhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset (NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts preferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce Confidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval based on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing knowledge conflicts and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy for context screening and end-to-end RAG performance, along with a notable reduction in retrieval costs while maintaining competitive accuracy. | Haoxiang Jin, Ronghan Li, Zixiang Lu, Qiguang Miao |
| UniSearch: Rethinking Search System with a Unified Generative Architecture | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06887](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06887) | Modern search systems play a crucial role in facilitating information acquisition. Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative search as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely end-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first and then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch, a unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces the cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search Generator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of relevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item embeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training framework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and improving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model and real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B testing in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong effectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in live search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of our product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world applications. | Jiahui Chen, Xiaoze Jiang, Zhibo Wang, Quanzhi Zhu, Junyao Zhao, Feng Hu, Kang Pan, Ao Xie, Maohua Pei, Zhiheng Qin, Hongjing Zhang, Zhixin Zhai, Xiaobo Guo, Runbin Zhou, Kefeng Wang, Mingyang Geng, Cheng Chen, Jingshan Lv, Yupeng Huang, Xiao Liang, Han Li |
| Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665) | Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions, which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g., implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks (MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination, similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic: direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the shots. | Jiajie He, Yuechun Gu, Min-Chun Chen, Keke Chen |
| Revealing Potential Biases in LLM-Based Recommender Systems in the Cold Start Setting | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20401) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining. We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis. | Alexandre Andre, Gauthier Roy, Eva Dyer, Kai Wang |

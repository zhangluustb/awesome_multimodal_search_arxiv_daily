| Knowledge Graph Tokenization for Behavior-Aware Generative Next POI Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12350](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12350) | Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has emerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation. Pioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a tokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by LLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for next POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two limitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals in the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2) previous instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while ignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of mobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation). Specifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG) format, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous information. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into an individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure, thus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB proposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific prediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit behaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive insights on the target POI visit behavior. Experiments on four real-world city datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB. | Ke Sun, Mayi Xu |
| Efficient Cold-Start Recommendation via BPE Token-Level Embedding Initialization with LLM | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13179) | The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems, especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight, but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the zero-shot setting is indicated within this work. | Yushang Zhao, Xinyue Han, Qian Leng, Qianyi Sun, Haotian Lyu, Chengrui Zhou |
| Research on Short-Video Platform User Decision-Making via Multimodal Temporal Modeling and Reinforcement Learning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12269](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12269) | This paper proposes the MT-DQN model, which integrates a Transformer, Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to address the challenges of predicting user behavior and optimizing recommendation strategies in short-video environments. Experiments demonstrated that MT-DQN consistently outperforms traditional concatenated models, such as Concat-Modal, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 10.97% and an average NDCG@5 improvement of 8.3%. Compared to the classic reinforcement learning model Vanilla-DQN, MT-DQN reduces MSE by 34.8% and MAE by 26.5%. Nonetheless, we also recognize challenges in deploying MT-DQN in real-world scenarios, such as its computational cost and latency sensitivity during online inference, which will be addressed through future architectural optimization. | Jinmeiyang Wang, Jing Dong, Li Zhou |
| Training-free Adjustable Polynomial Graph Filtering for Ultra-fast Multimodal Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04406](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04406) | Multimodal recommender systems improve the performance of canonical recommender systems with no item features by utilizing diverse content types such as text, images, and videos, while alleviating inherent sparsity of user-item interactions and accelerating user engagement. However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds. | Yu-Seung Roh, Joo-Young Kim, Jin-Duk Park, Won-Yong Shin |
| Tuning-Free LLM Can Build A Strong Recommender Under Sparse Connectivity And Knowledge Gap Via Extracting Intent | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10900](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10900) | Recent advances in recommendation with large language models (LLMs) often rely on either commonsense augmentation at the item-category level or implicit intent modeling on existing knowledge graphs. However, such approaches struggle to capture grounded user intents and to handle sparsity and cold-start scenarios. In this work, we present LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that constructs an intent-centric knowledge graph where both users and items are explicitly linked to intent nodes extracted by a tuning-free, RAG-guided LLM pipeline. By grounding intents in external knowledge sources and user profiles, IKGR canonically represents what a user seeks and what an item satisfies as first-class entities. To alleviate sparsity, we further introduce a mutual-intent connectivity densification strategy, which shortens semantic paths between users and long-tail items without requiring cross-graph fusion. Finally, a lightweight GNN layer is employed on top of the intent-enhanced graph to produce recommendation signals with low latency. Extensive experiments on public and enterprise datasets demonstrate that IKGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly on cold-start and long-tail slices, while remaining efficient through a fully offline LLM pipeline. | Wenqing Zheng, Noah Fatsi, Daniel Barcklow, Dmitri Kalaev, Steven Yao, Owen Reinert, C.

| Argumentative Experience: Reducing Confirmation Bias on Controversial Issues through LLM-Generated Multi-Persona Debates | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04629](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04629) | Multi-persona debate systems powered by large language models (LLMs) show promise in reducing confirmation bias, which can fuel echo chambers and social polarization. However, empirical evidence remains limited on whether they meaningfully shift user attention toward belief-challenging content, promote belief change, or outperform traditional debiasing strategies. To investigate this, we compare an LLM-based multi-persona debate system with a two-stance retrieval-based system, exposing participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial topics. By collecting eye-tracking data, belief change measures, and qualitative feedback, our results show that while the debate system does not significantly increase attention to opposing views, or make participants shift away from prior beliefs, it does provide a buffering effect against bias caused by individual cognitive tendency. These findings shed light on both the promise and limits of multi-persona debate systems in information seeking, and we offer design insights to guide future work toward more balanced and reflective information engagement. | Li Shi, Houjiang Liu, Yian Wong, Utkarsh Mujumdar, Dan Zhang, Jacek Gwizdka, Matthew Lease |

LLM-based Semantic Search for Conversational Queries in E-commerce,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16492,"Conversational user queries are increasingly challenging traditional e-commerce platforms, whose search systems are typically optimized for keyword-based queries. We present an LLM-based semantic search framework that effectively captures user intent from conversational queries by combining domain-specific embeddings with structured filters. To address the challenge of limited labeled data, we generate synthetic data using LLMs to guide the fine-tuning of two models: an embedding model that positions semantically similar products close together in the representation space, and a generative model for converting natural language queries into structured constraints. By combining similarity-based retrieval with constraint-based filtering, our framework achieves strong precision and recall across various settings compared to baseline approaches on a real-world dataset.","Emad Siddiqui, Venkatesh Terikuti, Xuan Lu"
PRISM: Purified Representation and Integrated Semantic Modeling for Generative Sequential Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16556,"Generative Sequential Recommendation (GSR) has emerged as a promising paradigm, reframing recommendation as an autoregressive sequence generation task over discrete Semantic IDs (SIDs), typically derived via codebook-based quantization. Despite its great potential in unifying retrieval and ranking, existing GSR frameworks still face two critical limitations: (1) impure and unstable semantic tokenization, where quantization methods struggle with interaction noise and codebook collapse, resulting in SIDs with ambiguous discrimination; and (2) lossy and weakly structured generation, where reliance solely on coarse-grained discrete tokens inevitably introduces information loss and neglects items' hierarchical logic. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative recommendation framework, PRISM, with Purified Representation and Integrated Semantic Modeling. Specifically, to ensure high-quality tokenization, we design a Purified Semantic Quantizer that constructs a robust codebook via adaptive collaborative denoising and hierarchical semantic anchoring mechanisms. To compensate for information loss during quantization, we further propose an Integrated Semantic Recommender, which incorporates a dynamic semantic integration mechanism to integrate fine-grained semantics and enforces logical validity through a semantic structure alignment objective. PRISM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across four real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial performance gains, particularly in high-sparsity scenarios.","Dengzhao Fang, Jingtong Gao, Yu Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Yi Chang"
LLM-powered Real-time Patent Citation Recommendation for Financial Technologies,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16775,"Rapid financial innovation has been accompanied by a sharp increase in patenting activity, making timely and comprehensive prior-art discovery more difficult. This problem is especially evident in financial technologies, where innovations develop quickly, patent collections grow continuously, and citation recommendation systems must be updated as new applications arrive. Existing patent retrieval and citation recommendation methods typically rely on static indexes or periodic retraining, which limits their ability to operate effectively in such dynamic settings. In this study, we propose a real-time patent citation recommendation framework designed for large and fast-changing financial patent corpora. Using a dataset of 428,843 financial patents granted by the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) between 2000 and 2024, we build a three-stage recommendation pipeline. The pipeline uses large language model (LLM) embeddings to represent the semantic content of patent abstracts, applies efficient approximate nearest-neighbor search to construct a manageable candidate set, and ranks candidates by semantic similarity to produce top-k citation recommendations. In addition to improving recommendation accuracy, the proposed framework directly addresses the dynamic nature of patent systems. By using an incremental indexing strategy based on hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) graphs, newly issued patents can be added without rebuilding the entire index. A rolling day-by-day update experiment shows that incremental updating improves recall while substantially reducing computational cost compared with rebuild-based indexing. The proposed method also consistently outperforms traditional text-based baselines and alternative nearest-neighbor retrieval approaches.","Tianang Deng, Yu Deng, Tianchen Gao, Yonghong Hu, Rui Pan"
Navigating the Shift: A Comparative Analysis of Web Search and Generative AI Response Generation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16858,"The rise of generative AI as a primary information source presents a paradigm shift from traditional web search. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study quantifying the fundamental differences between the results returned by Google Search and leading generative AI services. We analyze multiple dimensions, demonstrating that AI-generated answers and web search results diverge significantly in their consulted source domains, the typology of these domains (e.g., earned media vs. owned, social), query intent and the freshness of the information provided. We then investigate the role of LLM pre-training as a key factor shaping these differences, analyzing how this intrinsic knowledge base interacts with and influences real-time web search when enabled. Our findings reveal the distinct mechanics of these two information ecosystems, leading to critical observations on the emergent field of Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) and its contrast with traditional Search Engine Optimization (SEO).","Mahe Chen, Xiaoxuan Wang, Kaiwen Chen, Nick Koudas"
Better Generalizing to Unseen Concepts: An Evaluation Framework and An LLM-Based Auto-Labeled Pipeline for Biomedical Concept Recognition,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16711,"Generalization to unseen concepts is a central challenge due to the scarcity of human annotations in Mention-agnostic Biomedical Concept Recognition (MA-BCR). This work makes two key contributions to systematically address this issue. First, we propose an evaluation framework built on hierarchical concept indices and novel metrics to measure generalization. Second, we explore LLM-based Auto-Labeled Data (ALD) as a scalable resource, creating a task-specific pipeline for its generation. Our research unequivocally shows that while LLM-generated ALD cannot fully substitute for manual annotations, it is a valuable resource for improving generalization, successfully providing models with the broader coverage and structural knowledge needed to approach recognizing unseen concepts. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/bio-ie-tool/hi-ald.","Shanshan Liu, Noriki Nishida, Fei Cheng, Narumi Tokunaga, Rumana Ferdous Munne, Yuki Yamagata, Kouji Kozaki, Takehito Utsuro, Yuji Matsumoto"
SPRINT: Scalable and Predictive Intent Refinement for LLM-Enhanced Session-based Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00570,"Large language models (LLMs) have enhanced conventional recommendation models via user profiling, which generates representative textual profiles from users' historical interactions. However, their direct application to session-based recommendation (SBR) remains challenging due to severe session context scarcity and poor scalability. In this paper, we propose SPRINT, a scalable SBR framework that incorporates reliable and informative intents while ensuring high efficiency in both training and inference. SPRINT constrains LLM-based profiling with a global intent pool and validates inferred intents based on recommendation performance to mitigate noise and hallucinations under limited context. To ensure scalability, LLMs are selectively invoked only for uncertain sessions during training, while a lightweight intent predictor generalizes intent prediction to all sessions without LLM dependency at inference time. Experiments on real-world datasets show that SPRINT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while providing more explainable recommendations.","Gyuseok Lee, Wonbin Kweon, Zhenrui Yue, Yaokun Liu, Yifan Liu, Susik Yoon, Dong Wang, SeongKu Kang"
REG4Rec: Reasoning-Enhanced Generative Model for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15308,"Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.","Haibo Xing, Hao Deng, Yucheng Mao, Lingyu Mu, Jinxin Hu, Yi Xu, Hao Zhang, Jiahao Wang, Shizhun Wang, Yu Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng, Jing Zhang"
Topic-Specific Classifiers are Better Relevance Judges than Prompted LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04633,"The unjudged document problem, where systems that did not contribute to the original judgement pool may retrieve documents without a relevance judgement, is a key obstacle to the reuseability of test collections in information retrieval. While the de facto standard to deal with the problem is to treat unjudged documents as non-relevant, many alternatives have been proposed, such as the use of large language models (LLMs) as a relevance judge (LLM-as-a-judge). However, this has been criticized, among other things, as circular, since the same LLM can be used as the ranker and the judge. We propose to train topic-specific relevance classifiers instead: By finetuning monoT5 with independent LoRA weight adaptation on the judgments of a single assessor for a single topic's pool, we align it to that assessor's notion of relevance for the topic. The system rankings obtained through our classifier's relevance judgments achieve a Spearmans' $\rho$ correlation of $>0.94$ with ground truth system rankings. As little as 128 initial human judgments per topic suffice to improve the comparability of models, compared to treating unjudged documents as non-relevant, while achieving more reliability than existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Topic-specific relevance classifiers are thus a lightweight and straightforward way to tackle the unjudged document problem, while maintaining human judgments as the gold standard for retrieval evaluation. Code, models, and data are made openly available.","Lukas Gienapp, Martin Potthast, Andrew Yates, Harrisen Scells, Eugene Yang"
LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.","Shijun Li, Yu Wang, Jin Wang, Ying Li, Joydeep Ghosh, Anne Cocos"
Unified Multimodal Interleaved Document Representation for Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02729,"Information Retrieval (IR) methods aim to identify documents relevant to a query, which have been widely applied in various natural language tasks. However, existing approaches typically consider only the textual content within documents, overlooking the fact that documents can contain multiple modalities, including images and tables. Also, they often segment each long document into multiple discrete passages for embedding, which prevents them from capturing the overall document context and interactions between paragraphs. To address these two challenges, we propose a method that holistically embeds documents interleaved with multiple modalities by leveraging the capability of recent vision-language models that enable the processing and integration of text, images, and tables into a unified format and representation. Moreover, to mitigate the information loss from segmenting documents into passages, instead of representing and retrieving passages individually, we further merge the representations of segmented passages into one single document representation, while we additionally introduce a reranking strategy to decouple and identify the relevant passage within the document if necessary. Then, through extensive experiments on diverse IR scenarios considering both the textual and multimodal queries, we show that our approach substantially outperforms relevant baselines, thanks to the consideration of the multimodal information within documents.","Jaewoo Lee, Joonho Ko, Jinheon Baek, Soyeong Jeong, Sung Ju Hwang"
ProveRAG: Provenance-Driven Vulnerability Analysis with Automated Retrieval-Augmented LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17406,"In cybersecurity, security analysts constantly face the challenge of mitigating newly discovered vulnerabilities in real-time, with over 300,000 vulnerabilities identified since 1999. The sheer volume of known vulnerabilities complicates the detection of patterns for unknown threats. While LLMs can assist, they often hallucinate and lack alignment with recent threats. Over 40,000 vulnerabilities have been identified in 2024 alone, which are introduced after most popular LLMs' (e.g., GPT-5) training data cutoff. This raises a major challenge of leveraging LLMs in cybersecurity, where accuracy and up-to-date information are paramount. Therefore, we aim to improve the adaptation of LLMs in vulnerability analysis by mimicking how an analyst performs such tasks. We propose ProveRAG, an LLM-powered system designed to assist in rapidly analyzing vulnerabilities with automated retrieval augmentation of web data while self-evaluating its responses with verifiable evidence. ProveRAG incorporates a self-critique mechanism to help alleviate the omission and hallucination common in the output of LLMs applied in cybersecurity applications. The system cross-references data from verifiable sources (NVD and CWE), giving analysts confidence in the actionable insights provided. Our results indicate that ProveRAG excels in delivering verifiable evidence to the user with over 99% and 97% accuracy in exploitation and mitigation strategies, respectively. ProveRAG guides analysts to secure their systems more effectively by overcoming temporal and context-window limitations while also documenting the process for future audits.","Reza Fayyazi, Stella Hoyos Trueba, Michael Zuzak, Shanchieh Jay Yang"

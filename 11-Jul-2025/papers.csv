A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251,"Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text, e.g., ""I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor"". Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations, implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a slight increase in computational overhead.","Aaron Goldstein, Ayan Dutta"
"Rankers, Judges, and Assistants: Towards Understanding the Interplay of LLMs in Information Retrieval Evaluation",https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19092,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information retrieval (IR), powering ranking, evaluation, and AI-assisted content creation. This widespread adoption necessitates a critical examination of potential biases arising from the interplay between these LLM-based components. This paper synthesizes existing research and presents novel experiment designs that explore how LLM-based rankers and assistants influence LLM-based judges. We provide the first empirical evidence of LLM judges exhibiting significant bias towards LLM-based rankers. Furthermore, we observe limitations in LLM judges' ability to discern subtle system performance differences. Contrary to some previous findings, our preliminary study does not find evidence of bias against AI-generated content. These results highlight the need for a more holistic view of the LLM-driven information ecosystem. To this end, we offer initial guidelines and a research agenda to ensure the reliable use of LLMs in IR evaluation.","Krisztian Balog, Donald Metzler, Zhen Qin"
Toward Holistic Evaluation of Recommender Systems Powered by Generative Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06667,"Recommender systems powered by generative models (Gen-RecSys) extend beyond classical item ranking by producing open-ended content, which simultaneously unlocks richer user experiences and introduces new risks. On one hand, these systems can enhance personalization and appeal through dynamic explanations and multi-turn dialogues. On the other hand, they might venture into unknown territory-hallucinating nonexistent items, amplifying bias, or leaking private information. Traditional accuracy metrics cannot fully capture these challenges, as they fail to measure factual correctness, content safety, or alignment with user intent.
  This paper makes two main contributions. First, we categorize the evaluation challenges of Gen-RecSys into two groups: (i) existing concerns that are exacerbated by generative outputs (e.g., bias, privacy) and (ii) entirely new risks (e.g., item hallucinations, contradictory explanations). Second, we propose a holistic evaluation approach that includes scenario-based assessments and multi-metric checks-incorporating relevance, factual grounding, bias detection, and policy compliance. Our goal is to provide a guiding framework so researchers and practitioners can thoroughly assess Gen-RecSys, ensuring effective personalization and responsible deployment.","Yashar Deldjoo, Nikhil Mehta, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, Shuai Zhang, Pablo Castells, Julian McAuley"
Multi-Head RAG: Solving Multi-Aspect Problems with LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05085,"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling the retrieval of documents into the LLM context to provide more accurate and relevant responses. Existing RAG solutions do not focus on queries that may require fetching multiple documents with substantially different contents. Such queries occur frequently, but are challenging because the embeddings of these documents may be distant in the embedding space, making it hard to retrieve them all. This paper introduces Multi-Head RAG (MRAG), a novel scheme designed to address this gap with a simple yet powerful idea: leveraging activations of Transformer's multi-head attention layer, instead of the decoder layer, as keys for fetching multi-aspect documents. The driving observation is that different attention heads learn to capture different data aspects. Harnessing the corresponding activations results in embeddings that represent various facets of data items and queries, improving the retrieval accuracy for complex queries. We provide an evaluation methodology and metrics, multi-aspect datasets, and real-world use cases to demonstrate MRAG's effectiveness. We show MRAG's design advantages over 18 RAG baselines, empirical improvements of up to 20% in retrieval success ratios, and benefits for downstream LLM generation. MRAG can be seamlessly integrated with existing RAG frameworks and benchmarks.","Maciej Besta, Ales Kubicek, Robert Gerstenberger, Marcin Chrapek, Roman Niggli, Patrik Okanovic, Yi Zhu, Patrick Iff, Michal Podstawski, Lucas Weitzendorf, Mingyuan Chi, Joanna Gajda, Piotr Nyczyk, J\""urgen M\""uller, Hubert Niewiadomski, Torsten Hoefler"

AcademicBrowse: Benchmarking Academic Browse Ability of LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13784,"Large Language Models (LLMs)' search capabilities have garnered significant attention. Existing benchmarks, such as OpenAI's BrowseComp, primarily focus on general search scenarios and fail to adequately address the specific demands of academic search. These demands include deeper literature tracing and organization, professional support for academic databases, the ability to navigate long-tail academic knowledge, and ensuring academic rigor. Here, we proposed AcademicBrowse, the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate the complex information retrieval capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in academic research. AcademicBrowse possesses the following key characteristics: Academic Practicality, where question content closely mirrors real academic learning and research environments, avoiding deliberately misleading models; High Difficulty, with answers that are challenging for single models (e.g., Grok DeepSearch or Gemini Deep Research) to provide directly, often requiring at least three deep searches to derive; Concise Evaluation, where limiting conditions ensure answers are as unique as possible, accompanied by clear sources and brief solution explanations, greatly facilitating subsequent audit and verification, surpassing the current lack of analyzed search datasets both domestically and internationally; and Broad Coverage, as the dataset spans at least 15 different academic disciplines. Through AcademicBrowse, we expect to more precisely measure and promote the performance improvement of LLMs in complex academic information retrieval tasks.

InsertRank: LLMs can reason over BM25 scores to Improve Listwise Reranking,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14086,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant strides across various information retrieval tasks, particularly as rerankers, owing to their strong generalization and knowledge-transfer capabilities acquired from extensive pretraining. In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents. With Deepseek-R1, InsertRank achieves a score of 37.5 on the BRIGHT benchmark. and 51.1 on the R2MED benchmark, surpassing previous methods.","Rahul Seetharaman, Kaustubh D. Dhole, Aman Bansal"
Vela: Scalable Embeddings with Voice Large Language Models for Multimodal Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14445,"Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have seen substantial progress in recent years. However, their ability to represent multimodal information in the acoustic domain remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vela, a novel framework designed to adapt MLLMs for the generation of universal multimodal embeddings. By leveraging MLLMs with specially crafted prompts and selected in-context learning examples, Vela effectively bridges the modality gap across various modalities. We then propose a single-modality training approach, where the model is trained exclusively on text pairs. Our experiments show that Vela outperforms traditional CLAP models in standard text-audio retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we introduce new benchmarks that expose CLAP models' limitations in handling long texts and complex retrieval tasks. In contrast, Vela, by harnessing the capabilities of MLLMs, demonstrates robust performance in these scenarios. Our code will soon be available.","Ruofan Hu, Yan Xia, Minjie Hong, Jieming Zhu, Bo Chen, Xiaoda Yang, Minghui Fang, Tao Jin"
LLM-Driven Data Generation and a Novel Soft Metric for Evaluating Text-to-SQL in Aviation MRO,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13785,"The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to text-to-SQL tasks promises to democratize data access, particularly in critical industries like aviation Maintenance, Repair, and Operation (MRO). However, progress is hindered by two key challenges: the rigidity of conventional evaluation metrics such as execution accuracy, which offer coarse, binary feedback, and the scarcity of domain-specific evaluation datasets. This paper addresses these gaps. To enable more nuanced assessment, we introduce a novel F1-score-based 'soft' metric that quantifies the informational overlap between generated and ground-truth SQL results. To address data scarcity, we propose an LLM-driven pipeline that synthesizes realistic question-SQL pairs from database schemas. We demonstrate our contributions through an empirical evaluation on an authentic MRO database. Our experiments show that the proposed soft metric provides more insightful performance analysis than strict accuracy, and our data generation technique is effective in creating a domain-specific benchmark. Together, these contributions offer a robust framework for evaluating and advancing text-to-SQL systems in specialized environments.","Patrick Sutanto, Jonathan Kenrick, Max Lorenz, Joan Santoso"

| Generative Product Recommendations for Implicit Superlative Queries | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18748](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18748) | In Recommender Systems, users often seek the best products through indirect, vague, or under-specified queries, such as "best shoes for trail running". Such queries, also referred to as implicit superlative queries, pose a significant challenge for standard retrieval and ranking systems as they lack an explicit mention of attributes and require identifying and reasoning over complex factors. We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate implicit attributes for ranking as well as reason over them to improve product recommendations for such queries. As a first step, we propose a novel four-point schema for annotating the best product candidates for superlative queries called SUPERB, paired with LLM-based product annotations. We then empirically evaluate several existing retrieval and ranking approaches on our new dataset, providing insights and discussing their integration into real-world e-commerce production systems. | Kaustubh D.

| Feature Fusion Revisited: Multimodal CTR Prediction for MMCTR Challenge | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18961](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18961) | With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an increasing number of researchers are exploring their application in recommendation systems. However, the high latency associated with large models presents a significant challenge for such use cases. The EReL@MIR workshop provided a valuable opportunity to experiment with various approaches aimed at improving the efficiency of multimodal representation learning for information retrieval tasks. As part of the competition's requirements, participants were mandated to submit a technical report detailing their methodologies and findings. Our team was honored to receive the award for Task 2 - Winner (Multimodal CTR Prediction). In this technical report, we present our methods and key findings. Additionally, we propose several directions for future work, particularly focusing on how to effectively integrate recommendation signals into multimodal representations. The codebase for our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/Lattice-zjj/MMCTR_Code, and the trained model weights can be accessed at: https://huggingface.co/FireFlyCourageous/MMCTR_DIN_MicroLens_1M_x1. | Junjie Zhou |
| LLM-Evaluation Tropes: Perspectives on the Validity of LLM-Evaluations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19076](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19076) | Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate information retrieval (IR) systems, generating relevance judgments traditionally made by human assessors. Recent empirical studies suggest that LLM-based evaluations often align with human judgments, leading some to suggest that human judges may no longer be necessary, while others highlight concerns about judgment reliability, validity, and long-term impact. As IR systems begin incorporating LLM-generated signals, evaluation outcomes risk becoming self-reinforcing, potentially leading to misleading conclusions.
  This paper examines scenarios where LLM-evaluators may falsely indicate success, particularly when LLM-based judgments influence both system development and evaluation. We highlight key risks, including bias reinforcement, reproducibility challenges, and inconsistencies in assessment methodologies. To address these concerns, we propose tests to quantify adverse effects, guardrails, and a collaborative framework for constructing reusable test collections that integrate LLM judgments responsibly. By providing perspectives from academia and industry, this work aims to establish best practices for the principled use of LLMs in IR evaluation. | Laura Dietz, Oleg Zendel, Peter Bailey, Charles Clarke, Ellese Cotterill, Jeff Dalton, Faegheh Hasibi, Mark Sanderson, Nick Craswell |
| Chatbot Arena Meets Nuggets: Towards Explanations and Diagnostics in the Evaluation of LLM Responses | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20006](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20006) | Battles, or side-by-side comparisons in so called arenas that elicit human preferences, have emerged as a popular approach to assessing the output quality of LLMs. Recently, this idea has been extended to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While undoubtedly representing an advance in evaluation, battles have at least two drawbacks, particularly in the context of complex information-seeking queries: they are neither explanatory nor diagnostic. Recently, the nugget evaluation methodology has emerged as a promising approach to evaluate the quality of RAG answers. Nuggets decompose long-form LLM-generated answers into atomic facts, highlighting important pieces of information necessary in a "good" response. In this work, we apply our AutoNuggetizer framework to analyze data from roughly 7K Search Arena battles provided by LMArena in a fully automatic manner. Our results show a significant correlation between nugget scores and human preferences, showcasing promise in our approach to explainable and diagnostic system evaluations. | Sahel Sharifymoghaddam, Shivani Upadhyay, Nandan Thakur, Ronak Pradeep, Jimmy Lin |
| Mitigating Modality Bias in Multi-modal Entity Alignment from a Causal Perspective | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19458](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19458) | Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to retrieve equivalent entities from different Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), a critical information retrieval task. Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios. | Taoyu Su, Jiawei Sheng, Duohe Ma, Xiaodong Li, Juwei Yue, Mengxiao Song, Yingkai Tang, Tingwen Liu |
| Annif at SemEval-2025 Task 5: Traditional XMTC augmented by LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19675](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19675) | This paper presents the Annif system in SemEval-2025 Task 5 (LLMs4Subjects), which focussed on subject indexing using large language models (LLMs). The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records from the bilingual TIBKAT database using the GND subject vocabulary. Our approach combines traditional natural language processing and machine learning techniques implemented in the Annif toolkit with innovative LLM-based methods for translation and synthetic data generation, and merging predictions from monolingual models. The system ranked first in the all-subjects category and second in the tib-core-subjects category in the quantitative evaluation, and fourth in qualitative evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining traditional XMTC algorithms with modern LLM techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of subject indexing in multilingual contexts. | Osma Suominen, Juho Inkinen, Mona Lehtinen |
| Knowledge Distillation of Domain-adapted LLMs for Question-Answering in Telecom | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20000](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20000) | Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the approaches to reduce the size of Large Language Models (LLMs). A LLM with smaller number of model parameters (student) is trained to mimic the performance of a LLM of a larger size (teacher model) on a specific task. For domain-specific tasks, it is not clear if teacher or student model, or both, must be considered for domain adaptation. In this work, we study this problem from perspective of telecom domain Question-Answering (QA) task. We systematically experiment with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) of teacher only, SFT of student only and SFT of both prior to KD. We design experiments to study the impact of vocabulary (same and different) and KD algorithms (vanilla KD and Dual Space KD, DSKD) on the distilled model. Multi-faceted evaluation of the distillation using 14 different metrics (N-gram, embedding and LLM-based metrics) is considered. Experimental results show that SFT of teacher improves performance of distilled model when both models have same vocabulary, irrespective of algorithm and metrics. Overall, SFT of both teacher and student results in better performance across all metrics, although the statistical significance of the same depends on the vocabulary of the teacher models. | Rishika Sen, Sujoy Roychowdhury, Sumit Soman, H.

| LLM-Generated Fake News Induces Truth Decay in News Ecosystem: A Case Study on Neural News Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20013](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20013) | Online fake news moderation now faces a new challenge brought by the malicious use of large language models (LLMs) in fake news production. Though existing works have shown LLM-generated fake news is hard to detect from an individual aspect, it remains underexplored how its large-scale release will impact the news ecosystem. In this study, we develop a simulation pipeline and a dataset with ~56k generated news of diverse types to investigate the effects of LLM-generated fake news within neural news recommendation systems. Our findings expose a truth decay phenomenon, where real news is gradually losing its advantageous position in news ranking against fake news as LLM-generated news is involved in news recommendation. We further provide an explanation about why truth decay occurs from a familiarity perspective and show the positive correlation between perplexity and news ranking. Finally, we discuss the threats of LLM-generated fake news and provide possible countermeasures. We urge stakeholders to address this emerging challenge to preserve the integrity of news ecosystems. | Beizhe Hu, Qiang Sheng, Juan Cao, Yang Li, Danding Wang |
| Generalized Contrastive Learning for Multi-Modal Retrieval and Ranking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08535](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08535) | Contrastive learning has gained widespread adoption for retrieval tasks due to its minimal requirement for manual annotations. However, popular training frameworks typically learn from binary (positive/negative) relevance, making them ineffective at incorporating desired rankings. As a result, the poor ranking performance of these models forces systems to employ a re-ranker, which increases complexity, maintenance effort and inference time. To address this, we introduce Generalized Contrastive Learning (GCL), a training framework designed to learn from continuous ranking scores beyond binary relevance. GCL encodes both relevance and ranking information into a unified embedding space by applying ranking scores to the loss function. This enables a single-stage retrieval system. In addition, during our research, we identified a lack of public multi-modal datasets that benchmark both retrieval and ranking capabilities. To facilitate this and future research for ranked retrieval, we curated a large-scale MarqoGS-10M dataset using GPT-4 and Google Shopping, providing ranking scores for each of the 10 million query-document pairs. Our results show that GCL achieves a 29.3% increase in NDCG@10 for in-domain evaluations and 6.0% to 10.0% increases for cold-start evaluations compared to the finetuned CLIP baseline with MarqoGS-10M. Additionally, we evaluated GCL offline on a proprietary user interaction data. GCL shows an 11.2% gain for in-domain evaluations. The dataset and the method are available at: https://github.com/marqo-ai/GCL. | Tianyu Zhu, Myong Chol Jung, Jesse Clark |
| ID-Free Not Risk-Free: LLM-Powered Agents Unveil Risks in ID-Free Recommender Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11690](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11690) | Recent advances in ID-free recommender systems have attracted significant attention for effectively addressing the cold start problem. However, their vulnerability to malicious attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we unveil a critical yet overlooked risk: LLM-powered agents can be strategically deployed to attack ID-free recommenders, stealthily promoting low-quality items in black-box settings. This attack exploits a novel rewriting-based deception strategy, where malicious agents synthesize deceptive textual descriptions by simulating the characteristics of popular items. To achieve this, the attack mechanism integrates two primary components: (1) a popularity extraction component that captures essential characteristics of popular items and (2) a multi-agent collaboration mechanism that enables iterative refinement of promotional textual descriptions through independent thinking and team discussion. To counter this risk, we further introduce a detection method to identify suspicious text generated by our discovered attack. By unveiling this risk, our work aims to underscore the urgent need to enhance the security of ID-free recommender systems. | Zongwei Wang, Min Gao, Junliang Yu, Xinyi Gao, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Shazia Sadiq, Hongzhi Yin |
| TutorLLM: Customizing Learning Recommendations with Knowledge Tracing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15709](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15709) | The integration of AI in education offers significant potential to enhance learning efficiency. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama, allow students to query a wide range of topics, providing unprecedented flexibility. However, LLMs face challenges, such as handling varying content relevance and lack of personalization. To address these challenges, we propose TutorLLM, a personalized learning recommender LLM system based on Knowledge Tracing (KT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The novelty of TutorLLM lies in its unique combination of KT and RAG techniques with LLMs, which enables dynamic retrieval of context-specific knowledge and provides personalized learning recommendations based on the student's personal learning state. Specifically, this integration allows TutorLLM to tailor responses based on individual learning states predicted by the Multi-Features with Latent Relations BERT-based KT (MLFBK) model and to enhance response accuracy with a Scraper model. The evaluation includes user assessment questionnaires and performance metrics, demonstrating a 10% improvement in user satisfaction and a 5\% increase in quiz scores compared to using general LLMs alone. | Zhaoxing Li, Vahid Yazdanpanah, Jindi Wang, Wen Gu, Lei Shi, Alexandra I.

| MSL: Not All Tokens Are What You Need for Tuning LLM as a Recommender | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04178](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04178) | Large language models (LLMs), known for their comprehension capabilities and extensive knowledge, have been increasingly applied to recommendation systems (RS). Given the fundamental gap between the mechanism of LLMs and the requirement of RS, researchers have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with recommendation-specific data to enhance their performance. Language Modeling Loss (LML), originally designed for language generation tasks, is commonly adopted. However, we identify two critical limitations of LML: 1) it exhibits significant divergence from the recommendation objective; 2) it erroneously treats all fictitious item descriptions as negative samples, introducing misleading training signals.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel Masked Softmax Loss (MSL) tailored for fine-tuning LLMs on recommendation. MSL improves LML by identifying and masking invalid tokens that could lead to fictitious item descriptions during loss computation. This strategy can effectively avoid the interference from erroneous negative signals and ensure well alignment with the recommendation objective supported by theoretical guarantees. During implementation, we identify a potential challenge related to gradient vanishing of MSL. To overcome this, we further introduce the temperature coefficient and propose an Adaptive Temperature Strategy (ATS) that adaptively adjusts the temperature without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets further validate the effectiveness of MSL, achieving an average improvement of 42.24% in NDCG@10.

| Enhancing LLM-Based Agents via Global Planning and Hierarchical Execution | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16563](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16563) | Intelligent agent systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in real-world applications. However, existing agent frameworks still face critical limitations in task planning and execution, restricting their effectiveness and generalizability. Specifically, current planning methods often lack clear global goals, leading agents to get stuck in local branches, or produce non-executable plans. Meanwhile, existing execution mechanisms struggle to balance complexity and stability, and their limited action space restricts their ability to handle diverse real-world tasks. To address these limitations, we propose GoalAct, a novel agent framework that introduces a continuously updated global planning mechanism and integrates a hierarchical execution strategy. GoalAct decomposes task execution into high-level skills, including searching, coding, writing and more, thereby reducing planning complexity while enhancing the agents' adaptability across diverse task scenarios. We evaluate GoalAct on LegalAgentBench, a benchmark with multiple types of legal tasks that require the use of multiple types of tools. Experimental results demonstrate that GoalAct achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with an average improvement of 12.22% in success rate. These findings highlight GoalAct's potential to drive the development of more advanced intelligent agent systems, making them more effective across complex real-world applications.

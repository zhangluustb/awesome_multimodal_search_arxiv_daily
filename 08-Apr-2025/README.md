| Learning Sparse Disentangled Representations for Multimodal Exclusion Retrieval | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03184) | Multimodal representations are essential for cross-modal retrieval, but they often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind retrieved results. Sparse disentangled representations offer a promising solution; however, existing methods rely heavily on text tokens, resulting in high-dimensional embeddings. In this work, we propose a novel approach that generates compact, fixed-size embeddings that maintain disentanglement while providing greater control over retrieval tasks. We evaluate our method on challenging exclusion queries using the MSCOCO and Conceptual Captions benchmarks, demonstrating notable improvements over dense models like CLIP, BLIP, and VISTA (with gains of up to 11% in AP@10), as well as over sparse disentangled models like VDR (achieving up to 21% gains in AP@10). Furthermore, we present qualitative results that emphasize the enhanced interpretability of our disentangled representations. |
| Talk2X -- An Open-Source Toolkit Facilitating Deployment of LLM-Powered Chatbots on the Web | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03343) | Integrated into websites, LLM-powered chatbots offer alternative means of navigation and information retrieval, leading to a shift in how users access information on the web. Yet, predominantly closed-sourced solutions limit proliferation among web hosts and suffer from a lack of transparency with regard to implementation details and energy efficiency. In this work, we propose our openly available agent Talk2X leveraging an adapted retrieval-augmented generation approach (RAG) combined with an automatically generated vector database, benefiting energy efficiency. Talk2X's architecture is generalizable to arbitrary websites offering developers a ready to use tool for integration. Using a mixed-methods approach, we evaluated Talk2X's usability by tasking users to acquire specific assets from an open science repository. Talk2X significantly improved task completion time, correctness, and user experience supporting users in quickly pinpointing specific information as compared to standard user-website interaction. Our findings contribute technical advancements to an ongoing paradigm shift of how we access information on the web. |
| EnrichIndex: Using LLMs to Enrich Retrieval Indices Offline | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03598) | Existing information retrieval systems excel in cases where the language of target documents closely matches that of the user query. However, real-world retrieval systems are often required to implicitly reason whether a document is relevant. For example, when retrieving technical texts or tables, their relevance to the user query may be implied through a particular jargon or structure, rather than explicitly expressed in their content. Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential in identifying such implied relevance by leveraging their reasoning skills. Nevertheless, current LLM-augmented retrieval is hindered by high latency and computation cost, as the LLM typically computes the query-document relevance online, for every query anew. To tackle this issue we introduce EnrichIndex, a retrieval approach which instead uses the LLM offline to build semantically-enriched retrieval indices, by performing a single pass over all documents in the retrieval corpus once during ingestion time. Furthermore, the semantically-enriched indices can complement existing online retrieval approaches, boosting the performance of LLM re-rankers. We evaluated EnrichIndex on five retrieval tasks, involving passages and tables, and found that it outperforms strong online LLM-based retrieval systems, with an average improvement of 11.7 points in recall @ 10 and 10.6 points in NDCG @ 10 compared to strong baselines. In terms of online calls to the LLM, it processes 293.3 times fewer tokens which greatly reduces the online latency and cost. Overall, EnrichIndex is an effective way to build better retrieval indices offline by leveraging the strong reasoning skills of LLMs. |
| FM2DS: Few-Shot Multimodal Multihop Data Synthesis with Knowledge Distillation for Question Answering | [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07030) | Multimodal multihop question answering (MMQA) requires reasoning over images and text from multiple sources. Despite advances in visual question answering, this multihop setting remains underexplored due to a lack of quality datasets. Existing methods focus on single-hop, single-modality, or short texts, limiting real-world applications like interpreting educational documents with long, multimodal content. To fill this gap, we introduce FM2DS, the first framework for creating a high-quality dataset for MMQA. Our approach consists of a 5-stage pipeline that involves acquiring relevant multimodal documents from Wikipedia, synthetically generating high-level questions and answers, and validating them through rigorous criteria to ensure data quality. We evaluate our methodology by training models on our synthesized dataset and testing on two benchmarks: MultimodalQA and WebQA. Our results demonstrate that, with an equal sample size, models trained on our synthesized data outperform those trained on human-collected data by 1.9 in exact match (EM) score on average. Additionally, we introduce M2QA-Bench with 1k samples, the first benchmark for MMQA on long documents, generated using FM2DS and refined by human annotators. We believe our data synthesis method will serve as a strong foundation for training and evaluating MMQA models. |

| MuCo: Multi-turn Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Embedding Model | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06393](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06393) | Universal Multimodal embedding models built on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have traditionally employed contrastive learning, which aligns representations of query-target pairs across different modalities. Yet, despite its empirical success, they are primarily built on a "single-turn" formulation where each query-target pair is treated as an independent data point. This paradigm leads to computational inefficiency when scaling, as it requires a separate forward pass for each pair and overlooks potential contextual relationships between multiple queries that can relate to the same context. In this work, we introduce Multi-Turn Contrastive Learning (MuCo), a dialogue-inspired framework that revisits this process. MuCo leverages the conversational nature of MLLMs to process multiple, related query-target pairs associated with a single image within a single forward pass. This allows us to extract a set of multiple query and target embeddings simultaneously, conditioned on a shared context representation, amplifying the effective batch size and overall training efficiency. Experiments exhibit MuCo with a newly curated 5M multimodal multi-turn dataset (M3T), which yields state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB and M-BEIR benchmarks, while markedly enhancing both training efficiency and representation coherence across modalities.

| Multimodal Generative Retrieval Model with Staged Pretraining for Food Delivery on Meituan | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06654) | Multimodal retrieval models are becoming increasingly important in scenarios such as food delivery, where rich multimodal features can meet diverse user needs and enable precise retrieval. Mainstream approaches typically employ a dual-tower architecture between queries and items, and perform joint optimization of intra-tower and inter-tower tasks. However, we observe that joint optimization often leads to certain modalities dominating the training process, while other modalities are neglected. In addition, inconsistent training speeds across modalities can easily result in the one-epoch problem. To address these challenges, we propose a staged pretraining strategy, which guides the model to focus on specialized tasks at each stage, enabling it to effectively attend to and utilize multimodal features, and allowing flexible control over the training process at each stage to avoid the one-epoch problem. Furthermore, to better utilize the semantic IDs that compress high-dimensional multimodal embeddings, we design both generative and discriminative tasks to help the model understand the associations between SIDs, queries, and item features, thereby improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on large-scale real-world Meituan data demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 3.80%, 2.64%, and 2.17% on R@5, R@10, and R@20, and 5.10%, 4.22%, and 2.09% on N@5, N@10, and N@20 compared to mainstream baselines. Online A/B testing on the Meituan platform shows that our approach achieves a 1.12% increase in revenue and a 1.02% increase in click-through rate, validating the effectiveness and superiority of our method in practical applications. | Boyu Chen, Tai Guo, Weiyu Cui, Yuqing Li, Xingxing Wang, Chuan Shi, Cheng Yang |
| A methodology for analyzing financial needs hierarchy from social discussions using LLM | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06431](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06431) | This study examines the hierarchical structure of financial needs as articulated in social media discourse, employing generative AI techniques to analyze large-scale textual data. While human needs encompass a broad spectrum from fundamental survival to psychological fulfillment financial needs are particularly critical, influencing both individual well-being and day-to-day decision-making. Our research advances the understanding of financial behavior by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to extract and analyze expressions of financial needs from social media posts. We hypothesize that financial needs are organized hierarchically, progressing from short-term essentials to long-term aspirations, consistent with theoretical frameworks established in the behavioral sciences. Through computational analysis, we demonstrate the feasibility of identifying these needs and validate the presence of a hierarchical structure within them. In addition to confirming this structure, our findings provide novel insights into the content and themes of financial discussions online. By inferring underlying needs from naturally occurring language, this approach offers a scalable and data-driven alternative to conventional survey methodologies, enabling a more dynamic and nuanced understanding of financial behavior in real-world contexts. | Abhishek Jangra, Sachin Thukral, Arnab Chatterjee, Jayasree Raveendran |
| An item is worth one token in Multimodal Large Language Models-based Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05885](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05885) | Sequential recommendations (SR) predict users' future interactions based on their historical behavior. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought powerful generative and reasoning capabilities, significantly enhancing SR performance, while Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) further extend this by introducing data like images and interactive relationships. However, critical issues remain, i.e., (a) Suboptimal item representations caused by lengthy and redundant descriptions, leading to inefficiencies in both training and inference; (b) Modality-related cognitive bias, as LLMs are predominantly pretrained on textual data, limiting their ability to effectively integrate and utilize non-textual modalities; (c) Weakening sequential perception in long interaction sequences, where attention mechanisms struggle to capture earlier interactions, hindering the modeling of long-range dependencies. To address these issues, we propose Speeder, an efficient MLLM-based paradigm for SR featuring three key innovations: 1) Multimodal Representation Compression (MRC), which condenses item attributes into concise yet informative tokens, reducing redundancy and computational cost; 2) Modality-aware Progressive Optimization (MPO), enabling gradual learning of multimodal representations; 3) Sequential Position Awareness Enhancement (SPAE), improving the LLM's capability to capture both relative and absolute sequential dependencies in long interaction sequences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Speeder. Speeder increases training speed to 250% of the original while reducing inference time to 25% on the Amazon dataset. | Qiyong Zhong, Jiajie Su, Ming Yang, Yunshan Ma, Xiaolin Zheng, Chaochao Chen |
| LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Long-Term User Satisfaction in Interactive Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19585](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19585) | Interactive recommender systems can dynamically adapt to user feedback, but often suffer from content homogeneity and filter bubble effects due to overfitting short-term user preferences. While recent efforts aim to improve content diversity, they predominantly operate in static or one-shot settings, neglecting the long-term evolution of user interests. Reinforcement learning provides a principled framework for optimizing long-term user satisfaction by modeling sequential decision-making processes. However, its application in recommendation is hindered by sparse, long-tailed user-item interactions and limited semantic planning capabilities. In this work, we propose LLM-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning (LERL), a novel hierarchical recommendation framework that integrates the semantic planning power of LLM with the fine-grained adaptability of RL. LERL consists of a high-level LLM-based planner that selects semantically diverse content categories, and a low-level RL policy that recommends personalized items within the selected semantic space. This hierarchical design narrows the action space, enhances planning efficiency, and mitigates overexposure to redundant content. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LERL significantly improves long-term user satisfaction when compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The implementation of LERL is available at https://github.com/1163710212/LERL. | Chongjun Xia, Yanchun Peng, Xianzhi Wang |
| A Human-in-the-Loop, LLM-Centered Architecture for Knowledge-Graph Question Answering | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05512](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05512) | Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but remain limited in knowledge-intensive domains due to hallucinations, outdated information, and limited explainability. Text-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) helps ground model outputs in external sources but struggles with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), in contrast, support precise, explainable querying, yet require a knowledge of query languages. This work introduces an interactive framework in which LLMs generate and explain Cypher graph queries and users iteratively refine them through natural language. Applied to real-world KGs, the framework improves accessibility to complex datasets while preserving factual accuracy and semantic rigor and provides insight into how model performance varies across domains. Our core quantitative evaluation is a 90-query benchmark on a synthetic movie KG that measures query explanation quality and fault detection across multiple LLMs, complemented by two smaller real-life query-generation experiments on a Hyena KG and the MaRDI (Mathematical Research Data Initiative) KG. | Larissa Pusch, Alexandre Courtiol, Tim Conrad |

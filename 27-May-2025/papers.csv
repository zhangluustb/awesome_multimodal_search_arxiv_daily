MTGR: Industrial-Scale Generative Recommendation Framework in Meituan,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18654,"Scaling law has been extensively validated in many domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. In the recommendation system, recent work has adopted generative recommendations to achieve scalability, but their generative approaches require abandoning the carefully constructed cross features of traditional recommendation models. We found that this approach significantly degrades model performance, and scaling up cannot compensate for it at all. In this paper, we propose MTGR (Meituan Generative Recommendation) to address this issue. MTGR is modeling based on the HSTU architecture and can retain the original deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) features, including cross features. Additionally, MTGR achieves training and inference acceleration through user-level compression to ensure efficient scaling. We also propose Group-Layer Normalization (GLN) to enhance the performance of encoding within different semantic spaces and the dynamic masking strategy to avoid information leakage. We further optimize the training frameworks, enabling support for our models with 10 to 100 times computational complexity compared to the DLRM, without significant cost increases. MTGR achieved 65x FLOPs for single-sample forward inference compared to the DLRM model, resulting in the largest gain in nearly two years both offline and online. This breakthrough was successfully deployed on Meituan, the world's largest food delivery platform, where it has been handling the main traffic.","Ruidong Han, Bin Yin, Shangyu Chen, He Jiang, Fei Jiang, Xiang Li, Chi Ma, Mincong Huang, Xiaoguang Li, Chunzhen Jing, Yueming Han, Menglei Zhou, Lei Yu, Chuan Liu, Wei Lin"
Enhancing LLMs' Reasoning-Intensive Multimedia Search Capabilities through Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18831,"Existing large language models (LLMs) driven search agents typically rely on prompt engineering to decouple the user queries into search plans, limiting their effectiveness in complex scenarios requiring reasoning. Furthermore, they suffer from excessive token consumption due to Python-based search plan representations and inadequate integration of multimedia elements for both input processing and response generation. To address these challenges, we introduce SearchExpert, a training method for LLMs to improve their multimedia search capabilities in response to complex search queries. Firstly, we reformulate the search plan in an efficient natural language representation to reduce token consumption. Then, we propose the supervised fine-tuning for searching (SFTS) to fine-tune LLM to adapt to these representations, together with an automated dataset construction pipeline. Secondly, to improve reasoning-intensive search capabilities, we propose the reinforcement learning from search feedback (RLSF) that takes the search results planned by LLM as the reward signals. Thirdly, we propose a multimedia understanding and generation agent that enables the fine-tuned LLM to process visual input and produce visual output during inference. Finally, we establish an automated benchmark construction pipeline and a human evaluation framework. Our resulting benchmark, SearchExpertBench-25, comprises 200 multiple-choice questions spanning financial and international news scenarios that require reasoning in searching. Experiments demonstrate that SearchExpert outperforms the commercial LLM search method (Perplexity Pro) by 36.60% on the existing FinSearchBench-24 benchmark and 54.54% on our proposed SearchExpertBench-25. Human evaluations further confirm the superior readability.","Jinzheng Li, Sibo Ju, Yanzhou Su, Hongguang Li, Yiqing Shen"
RankLLM: A Python Package for Reranking with LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19284,"The adoption of large language models (LLMs) as rerankers in multi-stage retrieval systems has gained significant traction in academia and industry. These models refine a candidate list of retrieved documents, often through carefully designed prompts, and are typically used in applications built on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This paper introduces RankLLM, an open-source Python package for reranking that is modular, highly configurable, and supports both proprietary and open-source LLMs in customized reranking workflows. To improve usability, RankLLM features optional integration with Pyserini for retrieval and provides integrated evaluation for multi-stage pipelines. Additionally, RankLLM includes a module for detailed analysis of input prompts and LLM responses, addressing reliability concerns with LLM APIs and non-deterministic behavior in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. This paper presents the architecture of RankLLM, along with a detailed step-by-step guide and sample code. We reproduce results from RankGPT, LRL, RankVicuna, RankZephyr, and other recent models. RankLLM integrates with common inference frameworks and a wide range of LLMs. This compatibility allows for quick reproduction of reported results, helping to speed up both research and real-world applications. The complete repository is available at rankllm.ai, and the package can be installed via PyPI.","Sahel Sharifymoghaddam, Ronak Pradeep, Andre Slavescu, Ryan Nguyen, Andrew Xu, Zijian Chen, Yilin Zhang, Yidi Chen, Jasper Xian, Jimmy Lin"
DocMMIR: A Framework for Document Multi-modal Information Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19312,"The rapid advancement of unsupervised representation learning and large-scale pre-trained vision-language models has significantly improved cross-modal retrieval tasks. However, existing multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) studies lack a comprehensive exploration of document-level retrieval and suffer from the absence of cross-domain datasets at this granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce DocMMIR, a novel multi-modal document retrieval framework designed explicitly to unify diverse document formats and domains, including Wikipedia articles, scientific papers (arXiv), and presentation slides, within a comprehensive retrieval scenario. We construct a large-scale cross-domain multimodal benchmark, comprising 450K samples, which systematically integrates textual and visual information. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals substantial limitations in current state-of-the-art MLLMs (CLIP, BLIP2, SigLIP-2, ALIGN) when applied to our tasks, with only CLIP demonstrating reasonable zero-shot performance. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic investigation of training strategies, including cross-modal fusion methods and loss functions, and develop a tailored approach to train CLIP on our benchmark. This results in a +31% improvement in MRR@10 compared to the zero-shot baseline. All our data and code are released in https://github.com/J1mL1/DocMMIR.","Zirui Li, Siwei Wu, Xingyu Wang, Yi Zhou, Yizhi Li, Chenghua Lin"
LLMs as Better Recommenders with Natural Language Collaborative Signals: A Self-Assessing Retrieval Approach,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19464,"Incorporating collaborative information (CI) effectively is crucial for leveraging LLMs in recommendation tasks. Existing approaches often encode CI using soft tokens or abstract identifiers, which introduces a semantic misalignment with the LLM's natural language pretraining and hampers knowledge integration. To address this, we propose expressing CI directly in natural language to better align with LLMs' semantic space. We achieve this by retrieving a curated set of the most relevant user behaviors in natural language form. However, identifying informative CI is challenging due to the complexity of similarity and utility assessment. To tackle this, we introduce a Self-assessing COllaborative REtrieval framework (SCORE) following the retrieve-rerank paradigm. First, a Collaborative Retriever (CAR) is developed to consider both collaborative patterns and semantic similarity. Then, a Self-assessing Reranker (SARE) leverages LLMs' own reasoning to assess and prioritize retrieved behaviors. Finally, the selected behaviors are prepended to the LLM prompt as natural-language CI to guide recommendation. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate the effectiveness of SCORE in improving LLM-based recommendation.","Haoran Xin, Ying Sun, Chao Wang, Weijia Zhang, Hui Xiong"
Improving Recommendation Fairness without Sensitive Attributes Using Multi-Persona LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19473,"Despite the success of recommender systems in alleviating information overload, fairness issues have raised concerns in recent years, potentially leading to unequal treatment for certain user groups. While efforts have been made to improve recommendation fairness, they often assume that users' sensitive attributes are available during model training. However, collecting sensitive information can be difficult, especially on platforms that involve no personal information disclosure. Therefore, we aim to improve recommendation fairness without any access to sensitive attributes. However, this is a non-trivial task because uncovering latent sensitive patterns from complicated user behaviors without explicit sensitive attributes can be difficult. Consequently, suboptimal estimates of sensitive distributions can hinder the fairness training process. To address these challenges, leveraging the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel LLM-enhanced framework for Fair recommendation withOut Sensitive Attributes (LLMFOSA). A Multi-Persona Sensitive Information Inference module employs LLMs with distinct personas that mimic diverse human perceptions to infer and distill sensitive information. Furthermore, a Confusion-Aware Sensitive Representation Learning module incorporates inference results and rationales to develop robust sensitive representations, considering the mislabeling confusion and collective consensus among agents. The model is then optimized by a formulated mutual information objective. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate the effectiveness of LLMFOSA in improving fairness.","Haoran Xin, Ying Sun, Chao Wang, Yanke Yu, Weijia Zhang, Hui Xiong"
AgentRecBench: Benchmarking LLM Agent-based Personalized Recommender Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19623,"The emergence of agentic recommender systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in personalized recommendations, leveraging LLMs' advanced reasoning and role-playing capabilities to enable autonomous, adaptive decision-making. Unlike traditional recommendation approaches, agentic recommender systems can dynamically gather and interpret user-item interactions from complex environments, generating robust recommendation strategies that generalize across diverse scenarios. However, the field currently lacks standardized evaluation protocols to systematically assess these methods. To address this critical gap, we propose: (1) an interactive textual recommendation simulator incorporating rich user and item metadata and three typical evaluation scenarios (classic, evolving-interest, and cold-start recommendation tasks); (2) a unified modular framework for developing and studying agentic recommender systems; and (3) the first comprehensive benchmark comparing 10 classical and agentic recommendation methods. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of agentic systems and establish actionable design guidelines for their core components. The benchmark environment has been rigorously validated through an open challenge and remains publicly available with a continuously maintained leaderboard~\footnote[2]{https://tsinghua-fib-lab.github.io/AgentSocietyChallenge/pages/overview.html}, fostering ongoing community engagement and reproducible research.

Evidence-Grounded Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Attention-Based GNNs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18221,"Multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation is misinformation that repurposes real images with unrelated or misleading captions. Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.","Sharad Duwal, Mir Nafis Sharear Shopnil, Abhishek Tyagi, Adiba Mahbub Proma"
A Survey of LLM $\times$ DATA,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18458,"The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity, and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing), LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration.","Xuanhe Zhou, Junxuan He, Wei Zhou, Haodong Chen, Zirui Tang, Haoyu Zhao, Xin Tong, Guoliang Li, Youmin Chen, Jun Zhou, Zhaojun Sun, Binyuan Hui, Shuo Wang, Conghui He, Zhiyuan Liu, Jingren Zhou, Fan Wu"
Weaver: Interweaving SQL and LLM for Table Reasoning,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18961,"Querying tables with unstructured data is challenging due to the presence of text (or image), either embedded in the table or in external paragraphs, which traditional SQL struggles to process, especially for tasks requiring semantic reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context, they face limitations with long input sequences. Existing approaches that combine SQL and LLMs typically rely on rigid, predefined work-flows, limiting their adaptability to complex queries. To address these issues, we introduce Weaver , a modular pipeline that dynamically integrates SQL and LLMs for table-based question answering (TableQA). Weaver generates a flexible, step-by-step plan that combines SQL for structured data retrieval with LLMs for semantic processing. By decomposing complex queries into manageable subtasks, Weaver improves accuracy and generalization. Our experiments show that Weaver consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four TableQA datasets, reducing both API calls and error rates.","Rohit Khoja, Devanshu Gupta, Yanjie Fu, Dan Roth, Vivek Gupta"
Likert or Not: LLM Absolute Relevance Judgments on Fine-Grained Ordinal Scales,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19334,"Large language models (LLMs) obtain state of the art zero shot relevance ranking performance on a variety of information retrieval tasks. The two most common prompts to elicit LLM relevance judgments are pointwise scoring (a.k.a. relevance generation), where the LLM sees a single query-document pair and outputs a single relevance score, and listwise ranking (a.k.a. permutation generation), where the LLM sees a query and a list of documents and outputs a permutation, sorting the documents in decreasing order of relevance. The current research community consensus is that listwise ranking yields superior performance, and significant research effort has been devoted to crafting LLM listwise ranking algorithms. The underlying hypothesis is that LLMs are better at making relative relevance judgments than absolute ones. In tension with this hypothesis, we find that the gap between pointwise scoring and listwise ranking shrinks when pointwise scoring is implemented using a sufficiently large ordinal relevance label space, becoming statistically insignificant for many LLM-benchmark dataset combinations (where ``significant'' means ``95\% confidence that listwise ranking improves NDCG@10''). Our evaluations span four LLMs, eight benchmark datasets from the BEIR and TREC-DL suites, and two proprietary datasets with relevance labels collected after the training cut-off of all LLMs evaluated.","Charles Godfrey, Ping Nie, Natalia Ostapuk, David Ken, Shang Gao, Souheil Inati"
Modality Curation: Building Universal Embeddings for Advanced Multimodal Information Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19650,"Multimodal information retrieval (MIR) faces inherent challenges due to the heterogeneity of data sources and the complexity of cross-modal alignment. While previous studies have identified modal gaps in feature spaces, a systematic approach to address these challenges remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce UNITE, a universal framework that tackles these challenges through two critical yet underexplored aspects: data curation and modality-aware training configurations. Our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of how modality-specific data properties influence downstream task performance across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we propose Modal-Aware Masked Contrastive Learning (MAMCL) to mitigate the competitive relationships among the instances of different modalities. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by notable margins. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that strategic modality curation and tailored training protocols are pivotal for robust cross-modal representation learning. This work not only advances MIR performance but also provides a foundational blueprint for future research in multimodal systems.

MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19707,"Existing Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) methods typically train adapters that convert reference images into pseudo-text tokens, which are concatenated with the modifying text and processed by frozen text encoders in pretrained VLMs or LLMs. While this design leverages the strengths of large pretrained models, it only supervises the adapter to produce encoder-compatible tokens that loosely preserve visual semantics. Crucially, it does not directly optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and empirical validation. Furthermore, during inference, we further prompt the MLLM to generate target texts from composed queries and compute retrieval scores by integrating similarities between (i) the composed query and candidate images, and (ii) the MLLM-generated target text and candidate images. This strategy effectively combines the VLM's semantic alignment strengths with the MLLM's reasoning capabilities.","Rong-Cheng Tu, Zhao Jin, Jingyi Liao, Xiao Luo, Yingjie Wang, Li Shen, Dacheng Tao"
Multimodal Reasoning Agent for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19952,"Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a compositional query, consisting of a reference image and a modifying text-without relying on annotated training data. Existing approaches often generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image. Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries by directly constructing triplets, , using only unlabeled image data. By training on these synthetic triplets, our model learns to capture the relationships between compositional queries and candidate images directly. Extensive experiments on three standard CIR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. On the FashionIQ dataset, our method improves Average R@10 by at least 7.5\% over existing baselines; on CIRR, it boosts R@1 by 9.6\%; and on CIRCO, it increases mAP@5 by 9.5\%.","Rong-Cheng Tu, Wenhao Sun, Hanzhe You, Yingjie Wang, Jiaxing Huang, Li Shen, Dacheng Tao"
Research on feature fusion and multimodal patent text based on graph attention network,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20188,"Aiming at the problems of cross-modal feature fusion, low efficiency of long text modeling and lack of hierarchical semantic coherence in patent text semantic mining, this study proposes HGM-Net, a deep learning framework that integrates Hierarchical Comparative Learning (HCL), Multi-modal Graph Attention Network (M-GAT) and Multi-Granularity Sparse Attention (MSA), which builds a dynamic mask, contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints on the word, sentence and paragraph hierarchies through HCL. Contrast and cross-structural similarity constraints are constructed at the word and paragraph levels by HCL to strengthen the local semantic and global thematic consistency of patent text; M-GAT models patent classification codes, citation relations and text semantics as heterogeneous graph structures, and achieves dynamic fusion of multi-source features by cross-modal gated attention; MSA adopts a hierarchical sparsity strategy to optimize the computational efficiency of long text modeling at word, phrase, sentence and paragraph granularity. Experiments show that the framework demonstrates significant advantages over existing deep learning methods in tasks such as patent classification and similarity matching, and provides a solution with both theoretical innovation and practical value for solving the problems of patent examination efficiency improvement and technology relevance mining.","Zhenzhen Song, Ziwei Liu, Hongji Li"

To address this challenge, we propose a novel LLM-based reranking algorithm -- RaCT -- that implements SFT with Chain-of-Thought prompting, followed by a ranking preference optimization (RPO). The proposed RaCT aims to enhance ranking performance for LLMs while preserving their inherent language modeling abilities. Experimental evaluations on the three public ranking benchmarks (TREC DL, BEIR, and BRIGHT) and one LLM benchmark demonstrate the superior ranking performance of RaCT with a retained language understanding and reasoning capacity.","Haowei Liu, Xuyang Wu, Guohao Sun, Zhiqiang Tao, Yi Fang"
Order-agnostic Identifier for Large Language Model-based Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10833,"Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative recommendation has attracted significant research interest, where item tokenization is a critical step. It involves assigning item identifiers for LLMs to encode user history and generate the next item. Existing approaches leverage either token-sequence identifiers, representing items as discrete token sequences, or single-token identifiers, using ID or semantic embeddings. Token-sequence identifiers face issues such as the local optima problem in beam search and low generation efficiency due to step-by-step generation. In contrast, single-token identifiers fail to capture rich semantics or encode Collaborative Filtering (CF) information, resulting in suboptimal performance.
  To address these issues, we propose two fundamental principles for item identifier design: 1) integrating both CF and semantic information to fully capture multi-dimensional item information, and 2) designing order-agnostic identifiers without token dependency, mitigating the local optima issue and achieving simultaneous generation for generation efficiency. Accordingly, we introduce a novel set identifier paradigm for LLM-based generative recommendation, representing each item as a set of order-agnostic tokens. To implement this paradigm, we propose SETRec, which leverages CF and semantic tokenizers to obtain order-agnostic multi-dimensional tokens. To eliminate token dependency, SETRec uses a sparse attention mask for user history encoding and a query-guided generation mechanism for simultaneous token generation. We instantiate SETRec on T5 and Qwen (from 1.5B to 7B). Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness under various scenarios (e.g., full ranking, warm- and cold-start ranking, and various item popularity groups). Moreover, results validate SETRec's superior efficiency and show promising scalability on cold-start items as model sizes increase.","Xinyu Lin, Haihan Shi, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Qifan Wang, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua"
TALKPLAY: Multimodal Music Recommendation with Large Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13713,"We present TALKPLAY, a novel multimodal music recommendation system that reformulates recommendation as a token generation problem using large language models (LLMs). By leveraging the instruction-following and natural language generation capabilities of LLMs, our system effectively recommends music from diverse user queries while generating contextually relevant responses. While pretrained LLMs are primarily designed for text modality, TALKPLAY extends their scope through two key innovations: a multimodal music tokenizer that encodes audio features, lyrics, metadata, semantic tags, and playlist co-occurrence signals; and a vocabulary expansion mechanism that enables unified processing and generation of both linguistic and music-relevant tokens. By integrating the recommendation system directly into the LLM architecture, TALKPLAY transforms conventional systems by: (1) unifying previous two-stage conversational recommendation systems (recommendation engines and dialogue managers) into a cohesive end-to-end system, (2) effectively utilizing long conversational context for recommendation while maintaining strong performance in extended multi-turn interactions, and (3) generating natural language responses for seamless user interaction. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that TALKPLAY significantly outperforms unimodal approaches based solely on text or listening history in both recommendation performance and conversational naturalness.","Seungheon Doh, Keunwoo Choi, Juhan Nam"
Pre-training Generative Recommender with Multi-Identifier Item Tokenization,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04400,"Generative recommendation autoregressively generates item identifiers to recommend potential items. Existing methods typically adopt a one-to-one mapping strategy, where each item is represented by a single identifier. However, this scheme poses issues, such as suboptimal semantic modeling for low-frequency items and limited diversity in token sequence data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MTGRec, which leverages Multi-identifier item Tokenization to augment token sequence data for Generative Recommender pre-training. Our approach involves two key innovations: multi-identifier item tokenization and curriculum recommender pre-training. For multi-identifier item tokenization, we leverage the RQ-VAE as the tokenizer backbone and treat model checkpoints from adjacent training epochs as semantically relevant tokenizers. This allows each item to be associated with multiple identifiers, enabling a single user interaction sequence to be converted into several token sequences as different data groups. For curriculum recommender pre-training, we introduce a curriculum learning scheme guided by data influence estimation, dynamically adjusting the sampling probability of each data group during recommender pre-training. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model using a single tokenizer to ensure accurate item identification for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTGRec significantly outperforms both traditional and generative recommendation baselines in terms of effectiveness and scalability.","Bowen Zheng, Enze Liu, Zhongfu Chen, Zhongrui Ma, Yue Wang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen"
Universal Item Tokenization for Transferable Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04405,"Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, attracting significant research attention. The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.","Bowen Zheng, Hongyu Lu, Yu Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen"
Chatbot Arena Meets Nuggets: Towards Explanations and Diagnostics in the Evaluation of LLM Responses,https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20006,"Battles, or side-by-side comparisons in so-called arenas that elicit human preferences, have emerged as a popular approach for assessing the output quality of LLMs. Recently, this idea has been extended to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

Recently, the nugget evaluation methodology has emerged as a promising approach to evaluate the quality of RAG answers. Nuggets decompose long-form LLM-generated answers into atomic facts, highlighting important pieces of information necessary in a ""good"" response. In this work, we apply our AutoNuggetizer framework to analyze data from roughly 7K Search Arena battles provided by LMArena in a fully automatic manner.

ThinkRec: Thinking-based recommendation via LLM,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15091,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1 to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this, we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users' latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users, thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations.

Action is All You Need: Dual-Flow Generative Ranking Network for Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16752,"We introduce a Dual-Flow Generative Ranking Network (DFGR) for recommendation scenarios. This architecture utilizes only raw user behavior sequence information together with a small amount of basic information describing the behaviors to address the limitations of Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) that rely on extensive manual feature engineering. DFGR employs a dual-flow mechanism to optimize interaction modeling, ensuring efficient training and inference through end-to-end token processing. It duplicates the original user behavior sequence into a real flow and a fake flow based on whether the action information used is authentic and then defines a novel interaction method between the real flow and the fake flow within the QKV module of the self-attention mechanism. This design reduces computational overhead and improves both training efficiency and inference performance compared to Meta's HSTU-based model which can be considered the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in generative ranking. Our experiments in open-source and real industrial datasets show that DFGR outperforms DLRM, which can be regarded as an industrial online baseline that uses extensive feature engineering, Meta's HSTU approaches, and common recommendation architectures such as DIN, DCN, DIEN, and DeepFM. We also investigate optimal parameter allocation strategies under computational constraints, establishing DFGR as an efficient and effective next-generation generative ranking paradigm.","Hao Guo, Erpeng Xue, Lei Huang, Shichao Wang, Xiaolei Wang, Lei Wang, Jinpeng Wang, Sheng Chen"
Beyond Cascaded Architectures: An End-to-end Generative Framework for Industrial Advertising,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17549,"Traditional online industrial advertising systems suffer from the limitations of multi-stage cascaded architectures, which often discard high-potential candidates prematurely and distribute decision logic across disconnected modules. While recent generative recommendation approaches provide end-to-end solutions, they fail to address critical advertising requirements of key components for real-world deployment, such as explicit bidding, creative selection, ad allocation, and payment computation. To bridge this gap, we introduce End-to-End Generative Advertising (EGA), the first unified framework that holistically models user interests, point-of-interest (POI) and creative generation, ad allocation, and payment optimization within a single generative model. Our approach employs hierarchical tokenization and multi-token prediction to jointly generate POI recommendations and ad creatives, while a permutation-aware reward model and token-level bidding strategy ensure alignment with both user experiences and advertiser objectives. Additionally, we decouple allocation from payment using a differentiable ex-post regret minimization mechanism, guaranteeing approximate incentive compatibility at the POI level. Through extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online experiments on real-world advertising platforms, we demonstrate that EGA significantly outperforms traditional cascaded systems in both performance and practicality. Our results highlight its potential as a pioneering fully generative advertising solution, paving the way for next-generation industrial ad systems.","Zuowu Zheng, Ze Wang, Fan Yang, Jiangke Fan, Teng Zhang, Xingxing Wang"
iAgent: LLM Agent as a Shield between User and Recommender Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14662,"Traditional recommender systems usually take the user-platform paradigm, where users are directly exposed under the control of the platform's recommendation algorithms. However, the defect of recommendation algorithms may put users in very vulnerable positions under this paradigm. First, many sophisticated models are often designed with commercial objectives in mind, focusing on the platform's benefits, which may hinder their ability to protect and capture users' true interests. Second, these models are typically optimized using data from all users, which may overlook individual user's preferences. Due to these shortcomings, users may experience several disadvantages under the traditional user-platform direct exposure paradigm, such as lack of control over the recommender system, potential manipulation by the platform, echo chamber effects, or lack of personalization for less active users due to the dominance of active users during collaborative learning. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a new paradigm to protect user interests and alleviate these issues. Recently, some researchers have introduced LLM agents to simulate user behaviors, these approaches primarily aim to optimize platform-side performance, leaving core issues in recommender systems unresolved. To address these limitations, we propose a new user-agent-platform paradigm, where agent serves as the protective shield between user and recommender system that enables indirect exposure.","Wujiang Xu, Yunxiao Shi, Zujie Liang, Xuying Ning, Kai Mei, Kun Wang, Xi Zhu, Min Xu, Yongfeng Zhang"
StepSearch: Igniting LLMs Search Ability via Step-Wise Proximal Policy Optimization,https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15107,"Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2% absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our code will be released on https://github.com/Zillwang/StepSearch.","Ziliang Wang, Xuhui Zheng, Kang An, Cijun Ouyang, Jialu Cai, Yuhang Wang, Yichao Wu"

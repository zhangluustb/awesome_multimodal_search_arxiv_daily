LLM4MEA: Data-free Model Extraction Attacks on Sequential Recommenders via Large Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16969,"Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of sequential recommender systems to Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). MEAs collect responses from recommender systems to replicate their functionality, enabling unauthorized deployments and posing critical privacy and security risks. Black-box attacks in prior MEAs are ineffective at exposing recommender system vulnerabilities due to random sampling in data selection, which leads to misaligned synthetic and real-world distributions. To overcome this limitation, we propose LLM4MEA, a novel model extraction method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as human-like rankers to generate data. It generates data through interactions between the LLM ranker and target recommender system. In each interaction, the LLM ranker analyzes historical interactions to understand user behavior, and selects items from recommendations with consistent preferences to extend the interaction history, which serves as training data for MEA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4MEA significantly outperforms existing approaches in data quality and attack performance, reducing the divergence between synthetic and real-world data by up to 64.98% and improving MEA performance by 44.82% on average. From a defensive perspective, we propose a simple yet effective defense strategy and identify key hyperparameters of recommender systems that can mitigate the risk of MEAs.","Shilong Zhao, Fei Sun, Kaike Zhang, Shaoling Jing, Du Su, Zhichao Shi, Zhiyi Yin, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng"
VL-CLIP: Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations via Visual Grounding and LLM-Augmented CLIP Embeddings,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17080,"Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding. However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.","Ramin Giahi, Kehui Yao, Sriram Kollipara, Kai Zhao, Vahid Mirjalili, Jianpeng Xu, Topojoy Biswas, Evren Korpeoglu, Kannan Achan"
Exploring the Potential of LLMs for Serendipity Evaluation in Recommender Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17290,"Serendipity plays a pivotal role in enhancing user satisfaction within recommender systems, yet its evaluation poses significant challenges due to its inherently subjective nature and conceptual ambiguity. Current algorithmic approaches predominantly rely on proxy metrics for indirect assessment, often failing to align with real user perceptions, thus creating a gap. With large language models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies across various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core research proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity evaluation? To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two datasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains, focusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional proxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the efficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that even the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the performance of conventional metrics. Furthermore, multi-LLM techniques and the incorporation of auxiliary data further enhance alignment with human perspectives. Based on our findings, the optimal evaluation by LLMs yields a Pearson correlation coefficient of 21.5\% when compared to the results of the user study. This research implies that LLMs may serve as potentially accurate and cost-effective evaluators, introducing a new paradigm for serendipity evaluation in recommender systems.","Li Kang, Yuhan Zhao, Li Chen"
Multi-Label Classification with Generative AI Models in Healthcare: A Case Study of Suicidality and Risk Factors,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17009,"Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs), including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors. This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods, including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets, indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine.","Ming Huang, Zehan Li, Yan Hu, Wanjing Wang, Andrew Wen, Scott Lane, Salih Selek, Lokesh Shahani, Rodrigo Machado-Vieira, Jair Soares, Hua Xu, Hongfang Liu"
Parallelism Meets Adaptiveness: Scalable Documents Understanding in Multi-Agent LLM Systems,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17061,"Large language model (LLM) agents have shown increasing promise for collaborative task completion. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on static workflows, fixed roles, and limited inter-agent communication, reducing their effectiveness in open-ended, high-complexity domains. This paper proposes a coordination framework that enables adaptiveness through three core mechanisms: dynamic task routing, bidirectional feedback, and parallel agent evaluation. The framework allows agents to reallocate tasks based on confidence and workload, exchange structured critiques to iteratively improve outputs, and crucially compete on high-ambiguity subtasks with evaluator-driven selection of the most suitable result. We instantiate these principles in a modular architecture and demonstrate substantial improvements in factual coverage, coherence, and efficiency over static and partially adaptive baselines. Our findings highlight the benefits of incorporating both adaptiveness and structured competition in multi-agent LLM systems.","Chengxuan Xia, Qianye Wu, Sixuan Tian, Yilun Hao"
UNGER: Generative Recommendation with A Unified Code via Semantic and Collaborative Integration,https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06269,"With the rise of generative paradigms, generative recommendation has garnered increasing attention. The core component is the item code, generally derived by quantizing collaborative or semantic representations to serve as candidate items identifiers in the context. However, existing methods typically construct separate codes for each modality, leading to higher computational and storage costs and hindering the integration of their complementary strengths. Considering this limitation, we seek to integrate two different modalities into a unified code, fully unleashing the potential of complementary nature among modalities. Nevertheless, the integration remains challenging: the integrated embedding obtained by the common concatenation method would lead to underutilization of collaborative knowledge, thereby resulting in limited effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel method, named UNGER, which integrates semantic and collaborative knowledge into a unified code for generative recommendation. Specifically, we propose to adaptively learn an integrated embedding through the joint optimization of cross-modality knowledge alignment and next item prediction tasks. Subsequently, to mitigate the information loss caused by the quantization process, we introduce an intra-modality knowledge distillation task, using the integrated embeddings as supervised signals to compensate. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods.","Longtao Xiao, Haozhao Wang, Cheng Wang, Linfei Ji, Yifan Wang, Jieming Zhu, Zhenhua Dong, Rui Zhang, Ruixuan Li"

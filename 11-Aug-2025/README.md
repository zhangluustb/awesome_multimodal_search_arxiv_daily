| AquiLLM: a RAG Tool for Capturing Tacit Knowledge in Research Groups | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05648](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05648) | Research groups face persistent challenges in capturing, storing, and retrieving knowledge that is distributed across team members. Although structured data intended for analysis and publication is often well managed, much of a group's collective knowledge remains informal, fragmented, or undocumented--often passed down orally through meetings, mentoring, and day-to-day collaboration. This includes private resources such as emails, meeting notes, training materials, and ad hoc documentation. Together, these reflect the group's tacit knowledge--the informal, experience-based expertise that underlies much of their work. Accessing this knowledge can be difficult, requiring significant time and insider understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems offer promising solutions by enabling users to query and generate responses grounded in relevant source material. However, most current RAG-LLM systems are oriented toward public documents and overlook the privacy concerns of internal research materials. We introduce AquiLLM (pronounced ah-quill-em), a lightweight, modular RAG system designed to meet the needs of research groups. AquiLLM supports varied document types and configurable privacy settings, enabling more effective access to both formal and informal knowledge within scholarly groups. | Chandler Campbell, Bernie Boscoe, Tuan Do |
| Beyond Single Labels: Improving Conversational Recommendation through LLM-Powered Data Augmentation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05657](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05657) | Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) enhance recommendation quality by engaging users in multi-turn dialogues, capturing nuanced preferences through natural language interactions. However, these systems often face the false negative issue, where items that a user might like are incorrectly labeled as negative during training, leading to suboptimal recommendations.Expanding the label set through data augmentation presents an intuitive solution but faces the challenge of balancing two key aspects: ensuring semantic relevance and preserving the collaborative information inherent in CRS datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel data augmentation framework that first leverages an LLM-based semantic retriever to identify diverse and semantically relevant items, which are then filtered by a relevance scorer to remove noisy candidates. Building on this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy balancing semantic relevance and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and user simulators demonstrate significant and consistent performance improvements across various recommenders, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in advancing CRS performance. | Haozhe Xu, Xiaohua Wang, Changze Lv, Xiaoqing Zheng |
| A Survey of LLM-based Deep Search Agents: Paradigm, Optimization, Evaluation, and Challenges | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05668](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05668) | The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly revolutionized web search. The emergence of LLM-based Search Agents marks a pivotal shift towards deeper, dynamic, autonomous information seeking. These agents can comprehend user intentions and environmental context and execute multi-turn retrieval with dynamic planning, extending search capabilities far beyond the web. Leading examples like OpenAI's Deep Research highlight their potential for deep information mining and real-world applications. This survey provides the first systematic analysis of search agents. We comprehensively analyze and categorize existing works from the perspectives of architecture, optimization, application, and evaluation, ultimately identifying critical open challenges and outlining promising future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

| LLM4ES: Learning User Embeddings from Event Sequences via Large Language Models | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05688](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05688) | This paper presents LLM4ES, a novel framework that exploits large pre-trained language models (LLMs) to derive user embeddings from event sequences. Event sequences are transformed into a textual representation, which is subsequently used to fine-tune an LLM through next-token prediction to generate high-quality embeddings. We introduce a text enrichment technique that enhances LLM adaptation to event sequence data, improving representation quality for low-variability domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM4ES achieves state-of-the-art performance in user classification tasks in financial and other domains, outperforming existing embedding methods. The resulting user embeddings can be incorporated into a wide range of applications, from user segmentation in finance to patient outcome prediction in healthcare. | Aleksei Shestov, Omar Zoloev, Maksim Makarenko, Mikhail Orlov, Egor Fadeev, Ivan Kireev, Andrey Savchenko |
| Efficient Multimodal Streaming Recommendation via Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05993](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05993) | Streaming recommender systems (SRSs) are widely deployed in real-world applications, where user interests shift and new items arrive over time. As a result, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as interactions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack sufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using multimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features. However, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not tailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user tastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual tones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming scenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk of forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts (XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation. XSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert networks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in response to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert and backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains model compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without overwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold start and shifting preferences in multimodal features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that XSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation quality and computational efficiency. | Yunke Qu, Liang Qu, Tong Chen, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Hongzhi Yin |
| Semantic Item Graph Enhancement for Multimodal Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06154](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06154) | Multimodal recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention for their improved performance by leveraging items' multimodal information. Prior methods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw modality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the user-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these semantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient modeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions introduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising performance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals from the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item semantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based personalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with modulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive views. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through contrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in semantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism that first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based InfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns behavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to ensure representation consistency. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework. | Xiaoxiong Zhang, Xin Zhou, Zhiwei Zeng, Dusit Niyato, Zhiqi Shen |
| M2IO-R1: An Efficient RL-Enhanced Reasoning Framework for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Multimodal Generation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06328](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06328) | Current research on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables diverse multimodal inputs but remains limited to single-modality outputs, restricting expressive capacity and practical utility. In contrast, real-world applications often demand both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs for effective communication and grounded reasoning. Motivated by the recent success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we adopt RL as a principled and effective paradigm to address the multi-step, outcome-driven challenges inherent in multimodal output generation. Here, we introduce M2IO-R1, a novel framework for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) that supports both multimodal inputs and outputs. Central to our framework is an RL-based inserter, Inserter-R1-3B, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization to guide image selection and placement in a controllable and semantically aligned manner. Empirical results show that our lightweight 3B inserter achieves strong reasoning capabilities with significantly reduced latency, outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency. | Zhiyou Xiao, Qinhan Yu, Binghui Li, Geng Chen, Chong Chen, Wentao Zhang |
| When a Paper Has 1000 Authors: Rethinking Citation Metrics in the Era of LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06004](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06004) | Author-level citation metrics provide a practical, interpretable, and scalable signal of scholarly influence in a complex research ecosystem. It has been widely used as a proxy in hiring decisions. However, the past five years have seen the rapid emergence of large-scale publications in the field of large language models and foundation models, with papers featuring hundreds to thousands of co-authors and receiving tens of thousands of citations within months. For example, Gemini has 1361 authors and has been cited around 4600 times in 19 months. In such cases, traditional metrics, such as total citation count and the $h$-index, fail to meaningfully distinguish individual contributions. Therefore, we propose the following research question: How can one identify standout researchers among thousands of co-authors in large-scale LLM papers? This question is particularly important in scenarios such as academic hiring and funding decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel citation metric designed to address this challenge by balancing contributions across large-scale and small-scale publications. We propose the SBCI index, analyze its theoretical properties, and evaluate its behavior on synthetic publication datasets. Our results demonstrate that the proposed metric provides a more robust and discriminative assessment of individual scholarly impact in the era of large-scale collaborations. | Weihang Guo, Zhao Song, Jiahao Zhang |
| Few-Shot Prompting for Extractive Quranic QA with Instruction-Tuned LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06103](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06103) | This paper presents two effective approaches for Extractive Question Answering (QA) on the Quran. It addresses challenges related to complex language, unique terminology, and deep meaning in the text. The second uses few-shot prompting with instruction-tuned large language models such as Gemini and DeepSeek. A specialized Arabic prompt framework is developed for span extraction. A strong post-processing system integrates subword alignment, overlap suppression, and semantic filtering. This improves precision and reduces hallucinations. Evaluations show that large language models with Arabic instructions outperform traditional fine-tuned models. The best configuration achieves a pAP10 score of 0.637. The results confirm that prompt-based instruction tuning is effective for low-resource, semantically rich QA tasks. | Mohamed Basem, Islam Oshallah, Ali Hamdi, Ammar Mohammed |
| CAMEF: Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting by Integrating Time Series Patterns and Salient Macroeconomic Announcements | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04592](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04592) | Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types. | Yang Zhang, Wenbo Yang, Jun Wang, Qiang Ma, Jie Xiong |

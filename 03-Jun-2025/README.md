| Rethinking Hybrid Retrieval: When Small Embeddings and LLM Re-ranking Beat Bigger Models | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00049](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00049) | This paper presents a comparison of embedding models in tri-modal hybrid retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. We investigate the fusion of dense semantic, sparse lexical, and graph-based embeddings, focusing on the performance of the MiniLM-v6 and BGE-Large architectures. Contrary to conventional assumptions, our results show that the compact MiniLM-v6 outperforms the larger BGE-Large when integrated with LLM-based re-ranking within our tri-modal hybrid framework. Experiments conducted on the SciFact, FIQA, and NFCorpus datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval quality with the MiniLM-v6 configuration. The performance difference is particularly pronounced in agentic re-ranking scenarios, indicating better alignment between MiniLM-v6's embedding space and LLM reasoning. Our findings suggest that embedding model selection for RAG systems should prioritize compatibility with multi-signal fusion and LLM alignment, rather than relying solely on larger models. This approach may reduce computational requirements while improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency. | Arjun Rao, Hanieh Alipour, Nick Pendar |
| Gated Multimodal Graph Learning for Personalized Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00107](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00107) | Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the cold-start and sparsity problems in collaborative filtering by incorporating rich content information, such as product images and textual descriptions. However, effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities into a unified recommendation framework remains a challenge. Existing approaches often rely on fixed fusion strategies or complex architectures , which may fail to adapt to modality quality variance or introduce unnecessary computational overhead.
  In this work, we propose RLMultimodalRec, a lightweight and modular recommendation framework that combines graph-based user modeling with adaptive multimodal item encoding. The model employs a gated fusion module to dynamically balance the contribution of visual and textual modalities, enabling fine-grained and content-aware item representations. Meanwhile, a two-layer LightGCN encoder captures high-order collaborative signals by propagating embeddings over the user-item interaction graph without relying on nonlinear transformations.
  We evaluate our model on a real-world dataset from the Amazon product domain. Experimental results demonstrate that RLMultimodalRec consistently outperforms several competitive baselines, including collaborative filtering, visual-aware, and multimodal GNN-based methods. The proposed approach achieves significant improvements in top-K recommendation metrics while maintaining scalability and interpretability, making it suitable for practical deployment. | Sibei Liu, Yuanzhe Zhang, Xiang Li, Yunbo Liu, Chengwei Feng, Hao Yang |
| AI4Contracts: LLM & RAG-Powered Encoding of Financial Derivative Contracts | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01063](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01063) | Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) are reshaping how AI systems extract and organize information from unstructured text. A key challenge is designing AI methods that can incrementally extract, structure, and validate information while preserving hierarchical and contextual relationships. We introduce CDMizer, a template-driven, LLM, and RAG-based framework for structured text transformation. By leveraging depth-based retrieval and hierarchical generation, CDMizer ensures a controlled, modular process that aligns generated outputs with predefined schema. Its template-driven approach guarantees syntactic correctness, schema adherence, and improved scalability, addressing key limitations of direct generation methods. Additionally, we propose an LLM-powered evaluation framework to assess the completeness and accuracy of structured representations. Demonstrated in the transformation of Over-the-Counter (OTC) financial derivative contracts into the Common Domain Model (CDM), CDMizer establishes a scalable foundation for AI-driven document understanding, structured synthesis, and automated validation in broader contexts. | Maruf Ahmed Mridul, Ian Sloyan, Aparna Gupta, Oshani Seneviratne |
| Generative Next POI Recommendation with Semantic ID | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01375](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01375) | Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation systems aim to predict the next destinations of user based on their preferences and historical check-ins. Existing generative POI recommendation methods usually employ random numeric IDs for POIs, limiting the ability to model semantic relationships between similar locations. In this paper, we propose Generative Next POI Recommendation with Semantic ID (GNPR-SID), an LLM-based POI recommendation model with a novel semantic POI ID (SID) representation method that enhances the semantic understanding of POI modeling. There are two key components in our GNPR-SID: (1) a Semantic ID Construction module that generates semantically rich POI IDs based on semantic and collaborative features, and (2) a Generative POI Recommendation module that fine-tunes LLMs to predict the next POI using these semantic IDs. By incorporating user interaction patterns and POI semantic features into the semantic ID generation, our method improves the recommendation accuracy and generalization of the model. To construct semantically related SIDs, we propose a POI quantization method based on residual quantized variational autoencoder, which maps POIs into a discrete semantic space. We also propose a diversity loss to ensure that SIDs are uniformly distributed across the semantic space. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNPR-SID substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 16% improvement in recommendation accuracy. | Dongsheng Wang, Yuxi Huang, Shen Gao, Yifan Wang, Chengrui Huang, Shuo Shang |
| GRAM: Generative Recommendation via Semantic-aware Multi-granular Late Fusion | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01673](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01673) | Generative recommendation is an emerging paradigm that leverages the extensive knowledge of large language models by formulating recommendations into a text-to-text generation task. However, existing studies face two key limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM), introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts, delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative recommendation models, achieving significant improvements of 11.5-16.0% in Recall@5 and 5.3-13.6% in NDCG@5. The source code is available at https://github.com/skleee/GRAM. | Sunkyung Lee, Minjin Choi, Eunseong Choi, Hye-young Kim, Jongwuk Lee |
| GLoSS: Generative Language Models with Semantic Search for Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01910](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01910) | We propose Generative Low-rank language model with Semantic Search (GLoSS), a generative recommendation framework that combines large language models with dense retrieval for sequential recommendation. Unlike prior methods such as GPT4Rec, which rely on lexical matching via BM25, GLoSS uses semantic search to retrieve relevant items beyond lexical matching. For query generation, we employ 4-bit quantized LlaMA-3 models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling efficient training and inference on modest hardware. We evaluate GLoSS on three real-world Amazon review datasets: Beauty, Toys, and Sports, and find that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Compared to traditional ID-based baselines, GLoSS improves Recall@5 by 33.3%, 52.8%, and 15.2%, and NDCG@5 by 30.0%, 42.6%, and 16.1%, respectively. It also outperforms LLM-based recommenders such as P5, GPT4Rec, LlamaRec and E4SRec with Recall@5 gains of 4.3%, 22.8%, and 29.5%. Additionally, user segment evaluations show that GLoSS performs particularly well for cold-start users in the Amazon Toys and Sports datasets, and benefits from longer user histories in Amazon Beauty dataset, demonstrating robustness across different levels of interaction lengths. | Krishna Acharya, Aleksandr V.

| Whose Name Comes Up? Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00074) | This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations. | Daniele Barolo, Chiara Valentin, Fariba Karimi, Luis Gal\'arraga, Gonzalo G.

| The World As Large Language Models See It: Exploring the reliability of LLMs in representing geographical features | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00203](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00203) | As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, questions about their trustworthiness in delivering factual information have become increasingly important. This concern also applies to their ability to accurately represent the geographic world. With recent advancements in this field, it is relevant to consider whether and to what extent LLMs' representations of the geographical world can be trusted. This study evaluates the performance of GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash in three key geospatial tasks: geocoding, elevation estimation, and reverse geocoding. In the geocoding task, both models exhibited systematic and random errors in estimating the coordinates of St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck, Austria, with GPT-4o showing greater deviations and Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrating more precision but a significant systematic offset. For elevation estimation, both models tended to underestimate elevations across Austria, though they captured overall topographical trends, and Gemini 2.0 Flash performed better in eastern regions. The reverse geocoding task, which involved identifying Austrian federal states from coordinates, revealed that Gemini 2.0 Flash outperformed GPT-4o in overall accuracy and F1-scores, demonstrating better consistency across regions. Despite these findings, neither model achieved an accurate reconstruction of Austria's federal states, highlighting persistent misclassifications. The study concludes that while LLMs can approximate geographic information, their accuracy and reliability are inconsistent, underscoring the need for fine-tuning with geographical information to enhance their utility in GIScience and Geoinformatics. | Omid Reza Abbasi, Franz Welscher, Georg Weinberger, Johannes Scholz |
| Needle: A Generative AI-Powered Multi-modal Database for Answering Complex Natural Language Queries | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00639](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00639) | Multi-modal datasets, like those involving images, often miss the detailed descriptions that properly capture the rich information encoded in each item. This makes answering complex natural language queries a major challenge in this domain. In particular, unlike the traditional nearest neighbor search, where the tuples and the query are represented as points in a single metric space, these settings involve queries and tuples embedded in fundamentally different spaces, making the traditional query answering methods inapplicable. Existing literature addresses this challenge for image datasets through vector representations jointly trained on natural language and images. This technique, however, underperforms for complex queries due to various reasons.
  This paper takes a step towards addressing this challenge by introducing a Generative-based Monte Carlo method that utilizes foundation models to generate synthetic samples that capture the complexity of the natural language query and represent it in the same metric space as the multi-modal data.
  Following this method, we propose Needle, a database for image data retrieval. Instead of relying on contrastive learning or metadata-searching approaches, our system is based on synthetic data generation to capture the complexities of natural language queries. Our system is open-source and ready for deployment, designed to be easily adopted by researchers and developers. The comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets verify that this system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art text-to-image retrieval methods in the literature. Any foundation model and embedder can be easily integrated into Needle to improve the performance, piggybacking on the advancements in these technologies. | Mahdi Erfanian, Mohsen Dehghankar, Abolfazl Asudeh |
| EGA-V2: An End-to-end Generative Framework for Industrial Advertising | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17549) | Traditional online industrial advertising systems suffer from the limitations of multi-stage cascaded architectures, which often discard high-potential candidates prematurely and distribute decision logic across disconnected modules. While recent generative recommendation approaches provide end-to-end solutions, they fail to address critical advertising requirements of key components for real-world deployment, such as explicit bidding, creative selection, ad allocation, and payment computation. To bridge this gap, we introduce End-to-End Generative Advertising (EGA-V2), the first unified framework that holistically models user interests, point-of-interest (POI) and creative generation, ad allocation, and payment optimization within a single generative model. Our approach employs hierarchical tokenization and multi-token prediction to jointly generate POI recommendations and ad creatives, while a permutation-aware reward model and token-level bidding strategy ensure alignment with both user experiences and advertiser objectives. Additionally, we decouple allocation from payment using a differentiable ex-post regret minimization mechanism, guaranteeing approximate incentive compatibility at the POI level. Through extensive offline evaluations we demonstrate that EGA-V2 significantly outperforms traditional cascaded systems in both performance and practicality. Our results highlight its potential as a pioneering fully generative advertising solution, paving the way for next-generation industrial ad systems. | Zuowu Zheng, Ze Wang, Fan Yang, Jiangke Fan, Teng Zhang, Yongkang Wang, Xingxing Wang |
| Yambda-5B -- A Large-Scale Multi-modal Dataset for Ranking And Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22238](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22238) | We present Yambda-5B, a large-scale open dataset sourced from the Yandex Music streaming platform. Yambda-5B contains 4.79 billion user-item interactions from 1 million users across 9.39 million tracks. The dataset includes two primary types of interactions: implicit feedback (listening events) and explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, unlikes and undislikes). In addition, we provide audio embeddings for most tracks, generated by a convolutional neural network trained on audio spectrograms. A key distinguishing feature of Yambda-5B is the inclusion of the is_organic flag, which separates organic user actions from recommendation-driven events. This distinction is critical for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms, as Yandex Music relies on recommender systems to personalize track selection for users. To support rigorous benchmarking, we introduce an evaluation protocol based on a Global Temporal Split, allowing recommendation algorithms to be assessed in conditions that closely mirror real-world use. We report benchmark results for standard baselines (ItemKNN, iALS) and advanced models (SANSA, SASRec) using a variety of evaluation metrics. By releasing Yambda-5B to the community, we aim to provide a readily accessible, industrial-scale resource to advance research, foster innovation, and promote reproducible results in recommender systems. | A.

| CKnowEdit: A New Chinese Knowledge Editing Dataset for Linguistics, Facts, and Logic Error Correction in LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05806](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05806) | Chinese, as a linguistic system rich in depth and complexity, is characterized by distinctive elements such as ancient poetry, proverbs, idioms, and other cultural constructs. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations in these specialized domains, highlighting the need for the development of comprehensive datasets that can assess, continuously update, and progressively improve these culturally-grounded linguistic competencies through targeted training optimizations. To address this gap, we introduce CKnowEdit, the first-ever Chinese knowledge editing dataset designed to correct linguistic, factual, and logical errors in LLMs. We collect seven types of knowledge from a wide range of sources, including classical texts, idioms, and content from Baidu Tieba Ruozhiba, taking into account the unique polyphony, antithesis, and logical structures inherent in the Chinese language. By analyzing this dataset, we highlight the challenges current LLMs face in mastering Chinese. Furthermore, our evaluation of state-of-the-art knowledge editing techniques reveals opportunities to advance the correction of Chinese knowledge. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit. | Jizhan Fang, Tianhe Lu, Yunzhi Yao, Ziyan Jiang, Xin Xu, Huajun Chen, Ningyu Zhang |
| Disentangling Likes and Dislikes in Personalized Generative Explainable Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13248](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13248) | Recent research on explainable recommendation generally frames the task as a standard text generation problem, and evaluates models simply based on the textual similarity between the predicted and ground-truth explanations. However, this approach fails to consider one crucial aspect of the systems: whether their outputs accurately reflect the users' (post-purchase) sentiments, i.e., whether and why they would like and/or dislike the recommended items. To shed light on this issue, we introduce new datasets and evaluation methods that focus on the users' sentiments. Specifically, we construct the datasets by explicitly extracting users' positive and negative opinions from their post-purchase reviews using an LLM, and propose to evaluate systems based on whether the generated explanations 1) align well with the users' sentiments, and 2) accurately identify both positive and negative opinions of users on the target items. We benchmark several recent models on our datasets and demonstrate that achieving strong performance on existing metrics does not ensure that the generated explanations align well with the users' sentiments. Lastly, we find that existing models can provide more sentiment-aware explanations when the users' (predicted) ratings for the target items are directly fed into the models as input. The datasets and benchmark implementation are available at: https://github.com/jchanxtarov/sent_xrec. | Ryotaro Shimizu, Takashi Wada, Yu Wang, Johannes Kruse, Sean O'Brien, Sai HtaungKham, Linxin Song, Yuya Yoshikawa, Yuki Saito, Fugee Tsung, Masayuki Goto, Julian McAuley |
| Ask in Any Modality: A Comprehensive Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08826](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08826) | Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and outdated knowledge due to their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets, benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval, fusion, augmentation, and generation. We review training strategies, robustness enhancements, loss functions, and agent-based approaches, while also exploring the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios. In addition, we outline open challenges and future directions to guide research in this evolving field. This survey lays the foundation for developing more capable and reliable AI systems that effectively leverage multimodal dynamic external knowledge bases.

| Understanding Inequality of LLM Fact-Checking over Geographic Regions with Agent and Retrieval models | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22877](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22877) | Fact-checking is a potentially useful application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat the growing dissemination of disinformation. However, the performance of LLMs varies across geographic regions. In this paper, we evaluate the factual accuracy of open and private models across a diverse set of regions and scenarios.
  Using a dataset containing 600 fact-checked statements balanced across six global regions we examine three experimental setups of fact-checking a statement: (1) when just the statement is available, (2) when an LLM-based agent with Wikipedia access is utilized, and (3) as a best case scenario when a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system provided with the official fact check is employed. Our findings reveal that regardless of the scenario and LLM used, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and LLaMA, statements from the Global North perform substantially better than those from the Global South. Furthermore, this gap is broadened for the more realistic case of a Wikipedia agent-based system, highlighting that overly general knowledge bases have a limited ability to address region-specific nuances. These results underscore the urgent need for better dataset balancing and robust retrieval strategies to enhance LLM fact-checking capabilities, particularly in geographically diverse contexts. | Bruno Coelho, Shujaat Mirza, Yuyuan Cui, Christina P\"opper, Damon McCoy |
| A Survey of LLM $\times$ DATA | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18458](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18458) | The integration of large language model (LLM) and data management (DATA) is rapidly redefining both domains. In this survey, we comprehensively review the bidirectional relationships. On the one hand, DATA4LLM, spanning large-scale data processing, storage, and serving, feeds LLMs with high quality, diversity, and timeliness of data required for stages like pre-training, post-training, retrieval-augmented generation, and agentic workflows: (i) Data processing for LLMs includes scalable acquisition, deduplication, filtering, selection, domain mixing, and synthetic augmentation; (ii) Data Storage for LLMs focuses on efficient data and model formats, distributed and heterogeneous storage hierarchies, KV-cache management, and fault-tolerant checkpointing; (iii) Data serving for LLMs tackles challenges in RAG (e.g., knowledge post-processing), LLM inference (e.g., prompt compression, data provenance), and training strategies (e.g., data packing and shuffling). On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration. | Xuanhe Zhou, Junxuan He, Wei Zhou, Haodong Chen, Zirui Tang, Haoyu Zhao, Xin Tong, Guoliang Li, Youmin Chen, Jun Zhou, Zhaojun Sun, Binyuan Hui, Shuo Wang, Conghui He, Zhiyuan Liu, Jingren Zhou, Fan Wu |

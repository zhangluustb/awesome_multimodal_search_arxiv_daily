| Spacetime-GR: A Spacetime-Aware Generative Model for Large Scale Online POI Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16126](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16126) | Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation). However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper, we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences, thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations. Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e., ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of millions of POIs and users. | Haitao Lin, Zhen Yang, Jiawei Xue, Ziji Zhang, Luzhu Wang, Yikun Gu, Yao Xu, Xin Li |
| EGRA:Toward Enhanced Behavior Graphs and Representation Alignment for Multimodal Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16170](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16170) | MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances, existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second, they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA. First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming its effectiveness. | Xiaoxiong Zhang, Xin Zhou, Zhiwei Zeng, Yongjie Wang, Dusit Niyato, Zhiqi Shen |
| An Auditable Pipeline for Fuzzy Full-Text Screening in Systematic Reviews: Integrating Contrastive Semantic Highlighting and LLM Judgment | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15822) | Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN). Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach), we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM) judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability. | Pouria Mortezaagha, Arya Rahgozar |
| Annif at the GermEval-2025 LLMs4Subjects Task: Traditional XMTC Augmented by Efficient LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15877](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15877) | This paper presents the Annif system in the LLMs4Subjects shared task (Subtask 2) at GermEval-2025. The task required creating subject predictions for bibliographic records using large language models, with a special focus on computational efficiency. Our system, based on the Annif automated subject indexing toolkit, refines our previous system from the first LLMs4Subjects shared task, which produced excellent results. We further improved the system by using many small and efficient language models for translation and synthetic data generation and by using LLMs for ranking candidate subjects. Our system ranked 1st in the overall quantitative evaluation of and 1st in the qualitative evaluation of Subtask 2. | Osma Suominen, Juho Inkinen, Mona Lehtinen |
| LLM-as-classifier: Semi-Supervised, Iterative Framework for Hierarchical Text Classification using Large Language Models | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16478](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16478) | The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero- and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and maintainable classification systems in industry applications. | Doohee You, Andy Parisi, Zach Vander Velden, Lara Dantas Inojosa |
| LLM-Based Agents for Competitive Landscape Mapping in Drug Asset Due Diligence | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16571](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16571) | In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis. | Alisa Vinogradova (Optic Inc), Vlad Vinogradov (Optic Inc), Dmitrii Radkevich (Optic Inc), Ilya Yasny (Optic Inc), Dmitry Kobyzev (Optic Inc), Ivan Izmailov (Optic Inc), Katsiaryna Yanchanka (Optic Inc), Andrey Doronichev (Optic Inc) |
| Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220) | Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations. | Hengran Zhang, Minghao Tang, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Shihao Liu, Daiting Shi, Dawei Yin, Xueqi Cheng |
| MTGR: Industrial-Scale Generative Recommendation Framework in Meituan | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18654) | Scaling law has been extensively validated in many domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. In the recommendation system, recent work has adopted generative recommendations to achieve scalability, but their generative approaches require abandoning the carefully constructed cross features of traditional recommendation models. We found that this approach significantly degrades model performance, and scaling up cannot compensate for it at all. In this paper, we propose MTGR (Meituan Generative Recommendation) to address this issue. MTGR is modeling based on the HSTU architecture and can retain the original deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) features, including cross features. Additionally, MTGR achieves training and inference acceleration through user-level compression to ensure efficient scaling. We also propose Group-Layer Normalization (GLN) to enhance the performance of encoding within different semantic spaces and the dynamic masking strategy to avoid information leakage. We further optimize the training frameworks, enabling support for our models with 10 to 100 times computational complexity compared to the DLRM, without significant cost increases. MTGR achieved 65x FLOPs for single-sample forward inference compared to the DLRM model, resulting in the largest gain in nearly two years both offline and online. This breakthrough was successfully deployed on Meituan, the world's largest food delivery platform, where it has been handling the main traffic. | Ruidong Han, Bin Yin, Shangyu Chen, He Jiang, Fei Jiang, Xiang Li, Chi Ma, Mincong Huang, Xiaoguang Li, Chunzhen Jing, Yueming Han, Menglei Zhou, Lei Yu, Chuan Liu, Wei Lin |
| Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction for Multimodal Semantic Embedding | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10264](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10264) | Searching for the $k$-nearest neighbors (KNN) in multimodal data retrieval is computationally expensive, particularly due to the inherent difficulty in comparing similarity measures across different modalities. Recent advances in multimodal machine learning address this issue by mapping data into a shared embedding space; however, the high dimensionality of these embeddings (hundreds to thousands of dimensions) presents a challenge for time-sensitive vision applications. This work proposes Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR), aiming to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings while preserving the ranking of KNN in the lower-dimensional space. One notable component of OPDR is a new measure function to quantify KNN quality as a global metric, based on which we derive a closed-form map between target dimensionality and key contextual parameters. We have integrated OPDR with multiple state-of-the-art dimension-reduction techniques, distance functions, and embedding models; experiments on a variety of multimodal datasets demonstrate that OPDR effectively retains recall high accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs. | Chengyu Gong, Gefei Shen, Luanzheng Guo, Nathan Tallent, Dongfang Zhao |

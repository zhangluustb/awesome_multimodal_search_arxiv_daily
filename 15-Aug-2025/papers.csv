Semantic IDs for Joint Generative Search and Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10478,"Generative models powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a unified solution for powering both recommendation and search tasks. A key design choice in these models is how to represent items, traditionally through unique identifiers (IDs) and more recently with Semantic IDs composed of discrete codes, obtained from embeddings. While task-specific embedding models can improve performance for individual tasks, they may not generalize well in a joint setting. In this paper, we explore how to construct Semantic IDs that perform well both in search and recommendation when using a unified model. We compare a range of strategies to construct Semantic IDs, looking into task-specific and cross-tasks approaches, and also whether each task should have its own semantic ID tokens in a joint search and recommendation generative model. Our results show that using a bi-encoder model fine-tuned on both search and recommendation tasks to obtain item embeddings, followed by the construction of a unified Semantic ID space provides an effective trade-off, enabling strong performance in both tasks. We hope these findings spark follow-up work on generalisable, semantically grounded ID schemes and inform the next wave of unified generative recommender architectures.","Gustavo Penha, Edoardo D'Amico, Marco De Nadai, Enrico Palumbo, Alexandre Tamborrino, Ali Vardasbi, Max Lefarov, Shawn Lin, Timothy Heath, Francesco Fabbri, Hugues Bouchard"
FuXi-\beta: Towards a Lightweight and Fast Large-Scale Generative Recommendation Model,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10615,"Scaling laws for autoregressive generative recommenders reveal potential for larger, more versatile systems but mean greater latency and training costs. To accelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative recommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\alpha$, identifying two efficiency bottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and the computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that relative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as attention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative forms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the question of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical experiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade the model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation models. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which avoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias, thereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key attention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new Attention-Free Token Mixer module. Furthermore, by applying this framework to FuXi-$\alpha$, we introduce a new model, FuXi-$\beta$. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\beta$ outperforms previous state-of-the-art models and achieves significant acceleration compared to FuXi-$\alpha$, while also adhering to the scaling law. Notably, FuXi-$\beta$ shows an improvement of 27% to 47% in the NDCG@10 metric on large-scale industrial datasets compared to FuXi-$\alpha$.

Hypercomplex Prompt-aware Multimodal Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10753,"Modern recommender systems face critical challenges in handling information overload while addressing the inherent limitations of multimodal representation learning. Existing methods suffer from three fundamental limitations: (1) restricted ability to represent rich multimodal features through a single representation, (2) existing linear modality fusion strategies ignore the deep nonlinear correlations between modalities, and (3) static optimization methods failing to dynamically mitigate the over-smoothing problem in graph convolutional network (GCN). To overcome these limitations, we propose HPMRec, a novel Hypercomplex Prompt-aware Multimodal Recommendation framework, which utilizes hypercomplex embeddings in the form of multi-components to enhance the representation diversity of multimodal features. HPMRec adopts the hypercomplex multiplication to naturally establish nonlinear cross-modality interactions to bridge semantic gaps, which is beneficial to explore the cross-modality features. HPMRec also introduces the prompt-aware compensation mechanism to aid the misalignment between components and modality-specific features loss, and this mechanism fundamentally alleviates the over-smoothing problem. It further designs self-supervised learning tasks that enhance representation diversity and align different modalities. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that HPMRec achieves state-of-the-art recommendation performance.","Zheyu Chen, Jinfeng Xu, Hewei Wang, Shuo Yang, Zitong Wan, Haibo Hu"
Why Do Open-Source LLMs Struggle with Data Analysis? A Systematic Empirical Study,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19794,"Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in automating data analysis tasks, yet open-source models face significant limitations in these kinds of reasoning-intensive scenarios. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance the data analysis capabilities of open-source LLMs. By curating a seed dataset of diverse, realistic scenarios, we evaluate model behavior across three core dimensions: data understanding, code generation, and strategic planning. Our analysis reveals three key findings: (1) Strategic planning quality serves as the primary determinant of model performance; (2) Interaction design and task complexity significantly influence reasoning capabilities; (3) Data quality demonstrates a greater impact than diversity in achieving optimal performance. We leverage these insights to develop a data synthesis methodology, demonstrating significant improvements in open-source LLMs' analytical reasoning capabilities.

MMRAG-DocQA: A Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation Method for Document Question-Answering with Hierarchical Index and Multi-Granularity Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00579,"The multi-modal long-context document question-answering task aims to locate and integrate multi-modal evidences (such as texts, tables, charts, images, and layouts) distributed across multiple pages, for question understanding and answer generation. The existing methods can be categorized into Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM)-based and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based methods. However, the former were susceptible to hallucinations, while the latter struggled for inter-modal disconnection and cross-page fragmentation. To address these challenges, a novel multi-modal RAG model, named MMRAG-DocQA, was proposed, leveraging both textual and visual information across long-range pages to facilitate accurate question answering. A hierarchical indexing method with the integration of flattened in-page chunks and topological cross-page chunks was designed to jointly establish in-page multi-modal associations and long-distance cross-page dependencies. By means of joint similarity evaluation and large language model (LLM)-based re-ranking, a multi-granularity semantic retrieval method, including the page-level parent page retrieval and document-level summary retrieval, was proposed to foster multi-modal evidence connection and long-distance evidence integration and reasoning. Experimental results performed on public datasets, MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL, demonstrated the superiority of our MMRAG-DocQA method in understanding and answering modality-rich and multi-page documents.","Ziyu Gong, Yihua Huang, Chengcheng Mai"

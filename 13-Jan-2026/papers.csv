KP-Agent: Keyword Pruning in Sponsored Search Advertising via LLM-Powered Contextual Bandits,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05257,"Sponsored search advertising (SSA) requires advertisers to constantly adjust keyword strategies. While bid adjustment and keyword generation are well-studied, keyword pruning-refining keyword sets to enhance campaign performance-remains under-explored. This paper addresses critical inefficiencies in current practices as evidenced by a dataset containing 0.5 million SSA records from a pharmaceutical advertiser on search engine Meituan, China's largest delivery platform. We propose KP-Agent, an LLM agentic system with domain tool set and a memory module. By modeling keyword pruning within a contextual bandit framework, KP-Agent generates code snippets to refine keyword sets through reinforcement learning. Experiments show KP-Agent improves cumulative profit by up to 49.28% over baselines.","Hou-Wan Long, Yicheng Song, Zidong Wang, Tianshu Sun"
From Events to Trending: A Multi-Stage Hotspots Detection Method Based on Generative Query Indexing,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05258,"LLM-based conversational systems have become a popular gateway for information access, yet most existing chatbots struggle to handle news-related trending queries effectively. To improve user experience, an effective trending query detection method is urgently needed to enable differentiated processing of such target traffic. However, current research on trending detection tailored to the dialogue system scenario remains largely unexplored, and methods designed for traditional search engines often underperform in conversational contexts due to radically distinct query distributions and expression patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-stage framework for trending detection, which achieves systematic optimization from both offline generation and online identification perspectives. Specifically, our framework first exploits selected hot events to generate index queries, establishing a key bridge between static events and dynamic user queries. It then employs a retrieval matching mechanism for real-time online detection of trending queries, where we introduce a cascaded recall and ranking architecture to balance detection efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to better adapt to the practical application scenario, our framework adopts a single-recall module as a cold-start strategy to collect online data for fine-tuning the reranker. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in both offline evaluations and online A/B tests, and user satisfaction is relatively improved by 27\% in terms of positive-negative feedback ratio.","Kaichun Wang, Yanguang Chen, Ting Zhang, Mengyao Bao, Keyu Chen, Xu Hu, Yongliang Wang, Jingsheng Yang, Jinsong Zhang, Fei Lu"
Quantifying Document Impact in RAG-LLMs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05260,"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by connecting them to external knowledge, improving accuracy and reducing outdated information. However, this introduces challenges such as factual inconsistencies, source conflicts, bias propagation, and security vulnerabilities, which undermine the trustworthiness of RAG systems. A key gap in current RAG evaluation is the lack of a metric to quantify the contribution of individual retrieved documents to the final output. To address this, we introduce the Influence Score (IS), a novel metric based on Partial Information Decomposition that measures the impact of each retrieved document on the generated response. We validate IS through two experiments. First, a poison attack simulation across three datasets demonstrates that IS correctly identifies the malicious document as the most influential in $86\%$ of cases. Second, an ablation study shows that a response generated using only the top-ranked documents by IS is consistently judged more similar to the original response than one generated from the remaining documents. These results confirm the efficacy of IS in isolating and quantifying document influence, offering a valuable tool for improving the transparency and reliability of RAG systems.","Armin Gerami, Kazem Faghih, Ramani Duraiswami"
LLM2IR: simple unsupervised contrastive learning makes long-context LLM great retriever,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05262,"Modern dense information retrieval (IR) models usually rely on costly large-scale pretraining. In this paper, we introduce LLM2IR, an efficient unsupervised contrastive learning framework to convert any decoder-only large language model (LLM) to an information retrieval model. Despite its simplicity, the effectiveness is proven among different LLMs on multiple IR benchmarks including LoCo, LongEmbed and BEIR. We also find that models with a longer context length tend to have a stronger IR capacity by comparing task performances of models in the same model family. Our work not only provides an effective way to build IR models on the state-of-the-art LLMs, but also shed light on the relationship between information retrieval ability and model context length, which helps the design of better information retrievers.",Xiaocong Yang
Retrieval-Augmented Multi-LLM Ensemble for Industrial Part Specification Extraction,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05266,"Industrial part specification extraction from unstructured text remains a persistent challenge in manufacturing, procurement, and maintenance, where manual processing is both time-consuming and error-prone. This paper introduces a retrieval-augmented multi-LLM ensemble framework that orchestrates nine state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) within a structured three-phase pipeline. RAGsemble addresses key limitations of single-model systems by combining the complementary strengths of model families including Gemini (2.0, 2.5, 1.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini), Mistral Large, and Gemma (1B, 4B, 3n-e4b), while grounding outputs in factual data using FAISS-based semantic retrieval. The system architecture consists of three stages: (1) parallel extraction by diverse LLMs, (2) targeted research augmentation leveraging high-performing models, and (3) intelligent synthesis with conflict resolution and confidence-aware scoring. RAG integration provides real-time access to structured part databases, enabling the system to validate, refine, and enrich outputs through similarity-based reference retrieval. Experimental results using real industrial datasets demonstrate significant gains in extraction accuracy, technical completeness, and structured output quality compared to leading single-LLM baselines. Key contributions include a scalable ensemble architecture for industrial domains, seamless RAG integration throughout the pipeline, comprehensive quality assessment mechanisms, and a production-ready solution suitable for deployment in knowledge-intensive manufacturing environments.","Muzakkiruddin Ahmed Mohammed, John R.

Transforming User Defined Criteria into Explainable Indicators with an Integrated LLM AHP System,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05267,"Evaluating complex texts across domains requires converting user defined criteria into quantitative, explainable indicators, which is a persistent challenge in search and recommendation systems. Single prompt LLM evaluations suffer from complexity and latency issues, while criterion specific decomposition approaches rely on naive averaging or opaque black-box aggregation methods. We present an interpretable aggregation framework combining LLM scoring with the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Our method generates criterion specific scores via LLM as judge, measures discriminative power using Jensen Shannon distance, and derives statistically grounded weights through AHP pairwise comparison matrices. Experiments on Amazon review quality assessment and depression related text scoring demonstrate that our approach achieves high explainability and operational efficiency while maintaining comparable predictive power, making it suitable for real time latency sensitive web services.","Geonwoo Bang, Dongho Kim, Moohong Min"
LEAPS: An LLM-Empowered Adaptive Plugin for Taobao AI Search,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05513,"The rapid advancement of large language models has reshaped user search cognition, driving a paradigm shift from discrete keyword-based search to high-dimensional conversational interaction. However, existing e-commerce search architectures face a critical capability deficit in adapting to this change. Users are often caught in a dilemma: precise natural language descriptions frequently trigger zero-result scenarios, while the forced simplification of queries leads to decision overload from noisy, generic results. To tackle this challenge, we propose LEAPS (LLM-Empowered Adaptive Plugin for Taobao AI Search), which seamlessly upgrades traditional search systems via a ""Broaden-and-Refine"" paradigm. Specifically, it attaches plugins to both ends of the search pipeline: (1) Upstream, a Query Expander acts as an intent translator. It employs a novel three-stage training strategy--inverse data augmentation, posterior-knowledge supervised fine-tuning, and diversity-aware reinforcement learning--to generate adaptive and complementary query combinations that maximize the candidate product set. (2) Downstream, a Relevance Verifier serves as a semantic gatekeeper. By synthesizing multi-source data (e.g., OCR text, reviews) and leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, it precisely filters noise to resolve selection overload. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that LEAPS significantly enhances conversational search experiences. Crucially, its non-invasive architecture preserves established retrieval performance optimized for short-text queries, while simultaneously allowing for low-cost integration into diverse back-ends. Fully deployed on Taobao AI Search since August 2025, LEAPS currently serves hundreds of millions of users monthly.","Lei Wang, Jinhang Wu, Zhibin Wang, Biye Li, Haiping Hou"
Revisiting Human-vs-LLM judgments using the TREC Podcast Track,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05603,"Using large language models (LLMs) to annotate relevance is an increasingly important technique in the information retrieval community. While some studies demonstrate that LLMs can achieve high user agreement with ground truth (human) judgments, other studies have argued for the opposite conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, these studies have primarily focused on classic ad-hoc text search scenarios. In this paper, we conduct an analysis on user agreement between LLM and human experts, and explore the impact disagreement has on system rankings. In contrast to prior studies, we focus on a collection composed of audio files that are transcribed into two-minute segments -- the TREC 2020 and 2021 podcast track. We employ five different LLM models to re-assess all of the query-segment pairs, which were originally annotated by TREC assessors. Furthermore, we re-assess a small subset of pairs where LLM and TREC assessors have the highest disagreement, and found that the human experts tend to agree with LLMs more than with the TREC assessors. Our results reinforce the previous insights of Sormunen in 2002 -- that relying on a single assessor leads to lower user agreement.","Watheq Mansour, J.

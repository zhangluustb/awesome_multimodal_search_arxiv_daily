GCRank: A Generative Contextual Comprehension Paradigm for Takeout Ranking Model,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02361,"The ranking stage serves as the central optimization and allocation hub in advertising systems, governing economic value distribution through eCPM and orchestrating the user-centric blending of organic and advertising content. Prevailing ranking models often rely on fragmented modules and hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to interpret complex user intent. This challenge is further amplified in location-based services such as food delivery, where user decisions are shaped by dynamic spatial, temporal, and individual contexts. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generative framework that reframes ranking as a context comprehension task, modeling heterogeneous signals in a unified architecture. Our architecture consists of two core components: the Generative Contextual Encoder (GCE) and the Generative Contextual Fusion (GCF). The GCE comprises three specialized modules: a Personalized Context Enhancer (PCE) for user-specific modeling, a Collective Context Enhancer (CCE) for group-level patterns, and a Dynamic Context Enhancer (DCE) for real-time situational adaptation. The GCF module then seamlessly integrates these contextual representations through low-rank adaptation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves significant gains in critical business metrics, including click-through rate and platform revenue. We have successfully deployed our method on a large-scale food delivery advertising platform, demonstrating its substantial practical impact. This work pioneers a new perspective on generative recommendation and highlights its practical potential in industrial advertising systems.","Ziheng Ni, Congcong Liu, Cai Shang, Yiming Sun, Junjie Li, Zhiwei Fang, Guangpeng Chen, Jian Li, Zehua Zhang, Changping Peng, Zhangang Lin, Ching Law, Jingping Shao"
"The Impact of LLM-Generated Reviews on Recommender Systems: Textual Shifts, Performance Effects, and Strategic Platform Control",https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02362,"The rise of generative AI technologies is reshaping content-based recommender systems (RSes), which increasingly encounter AI-generated content alongside human-authored content. This study examines how the introduction of AI-generated reviews influences RS performance and business outcomes. We analyze two distinct pathways through which AI content can enter RSes: user-centric, in which individuals use AI tools to refine their reviews, and platform-centric, in which platforms generate synthetic reviews directly from structured metadata. Using a large-scale dataset of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, we generate synthetic reviews using LLMs and evaluate their impact across the training and deployment phases of RSes. We find that AI-generated reviews differ systematically from human-authored reviews across multiple textual dimensions. Although both user- and platform-centric AI reviews enhance RS performance relative to models without textual data, models trained on human reviews consistently achieve superior performance, underscoring the quality of authentic human data. Human-trained models generalize robustly to AI content, whereas AI-trained models underperform on both content types. Furthermore, tone-based framing strategies (encouraging, constructive, or critical) substantially enhance platform-generated review effectiveness. Our findings highlight the strategic importance of platform control in governing the generation and integration of AI-generated reviews, ensuring that synthetic content complements recommendation robustness and sustainable business value.","Itzhak Ziv, Moshe Unger, Hilah Geva"
Towards Trustworthy LLM-Based Recommendation via Rationale Integration,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02364,"Traditional recommender systems (RS) have been primarily optimized for accuracy and short-term engagement, often overlooking transparency and trustworthiness. Recently, platforms such as Amazon and Instagram have begun providing recommendation rationales to users, acknowledging their critical role in fostering trust and enhancing engagement; however, most existing systems still treat them as post-hoc artifacts. We propose an LLM-based recommender (LLM-Rec) that not only predicts items but also generates logically grounded rationales. Our approach leverages a self-annotated rationale dataset and instruction tuning in a rationale-first format, where the model generates an explanation before outputting the recommended item. By adopting this strategy and representing rationales in a chain-of-thought (CoT) style, LLM-Rec strengthens both interpretability and recommendation performance. Experiments on the Fashion and Scientific domains of the Amazon Review dataset demonstrate significant improvements over well-established baselines. To encourage reproducibility and future research, we publicly release a rationale-augmented recommendation dataset containing user histories, rationales, and recommended items.","Chung Park, Taesan Kim, Hyeongjun Yun, Dongjoon Hong, Junui Hong, Kijung Park, MinCheol Cho, Mira Myong, Jihoon Oh, Min sung Choi"
FUSE : Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02365,"Multimodal creative assistants decompose user goals and route tasks to subagents for layout, styling, retrieval, and generation. Retrieval quality is pivotal, yet failures can arise at several stages: understanding user intent, choosing content types, finding candidates (recall), or ranking results. Meanwhile, sending and processing images is costly, making naive multimodal approaches impractical. We present FUSE: Failure-aware Usage of Subagent Evidence for MultiModal Search and Recommendation. FUSE replaces most raw-image prompting with a compact Grounded Design Representation (GDR): a selection aware JSON of canvas elements (image, text, shape, icon, video, logo), structure, styles, salient colors, and user selection provided by the Planner team. FUSE implements seven context budgeting strategies: comprehensive baseline prompting, context compression, chain-of-thought reasoning, mini-shot optimization, retrieval-augmented context, two-stage processing, and zero-shot minimalism. Finally, a pipeline attribution layer monitors system performance by converting subagent signals into simple checks: intent alignment, content-type/routing sanity, recall health (e.g., zero-hit and top-match strength), and ranking displacement analysis. We evaluate the seven context budgeting variants across 788 evaluation queries from diverse users and design templates (refer Figure 3). Our systematic evaluation reveals that Context Compression achieves optimal performance across all pipeline stages, with 93.3% intent accuracy, 86.8% routing success(with fallbacks), 99.4% recall, and 88.5% NDCG@5. This approach demonstrates that strategic context summarization outperforms both comprehensive and minimal contextualization strategies.","Tushar Vatsa, Vibha Belavadi, Priya Shanmugasundaram, Suhas Suresha, Dewang Sultania"
Netflix Artwork Personalization via LLM Post-training,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02764,"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated success in various applications of user recommendation and personalization across e-commerce and entertainment. On many entertainment platforms such as Netflix, users typically interact with a wide range of titles, each represented by an artwork. Since users have diverse preferences, an artwork that appeals to one type of user may not resonate with another with different preferences. Given this user heterogeneity, our work explores the novel problem of personalized artwork recommendations according to diverse user preferences. Similar to the multi-dimensional nature of users' tastes, titles contain different themes and tones that may appeal to different viewers. For example, the same title might feature both heartfelt family drama and intense action scenes. Users who prefer romantic content may like the artwork emphasizing emotional warmth between the characters, while those who prefer action thrillers may find high-intensity action scenes more intriguing. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we conduct post-training of pre-trained LLMs to make personalized artwork recommendations, selecting the most preferred visual representation of a title for each user and thereby improving user satisfaction and engagement. Our experimental results with Llama 3.1 8B models (trained on a dataset of 110K data points and evaluated on 5K held-out user-title pairs) show that the post-trained LLMs achieve 3-5\% improvements over the Netflix production model, suggesting a promising direction for granular personalized recommendations using LLMs.","Hyunji Nam, Sejoon Oh, Emma Kong, Yesu Feng, Moumita Bhattacharya"
How to Discover Knowledge for FutureG: Contextual RAG and LLM Prompting for O-RAN,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02382,"We present a retrieval-augmented question answering framework for 5G/6G networks, where the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become central to disaggregated, virtualized, and AI-driven wireless systems. While O-RAN enables multi-vendor interoperability and cloud-native deployments, its fast-changing specifications and interfaces pose major challenges for researchers and practitioners. Manual navigation of these complex documents is labor-intensive and error-prone, slowing system design, integration, and deployment. To address this challenge, we adopt Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Contextual RAG), a strategy in which candidate answer choices guide document retrieval and chunk-specific context to improve large language model (LLM) performance. This improvement over traditional RAG achieves more targeted and context-aware retrieval, which improves the relevance of documents passed to the LLM, particularly when the query alone lacks sufficient context for accurate grounding. Our framework is designed for dynamic domains where data evolves rapidly and models must be continuously updated or redeployed, all without requiring LLM fine-tuning. We evaluate this framework using the ORANBenchmark-13K dataset, and compare three LLMs, namely, Llama3.2, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen3.0-4B, across both Direct Question Answering (Direct Q&amp;A) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies. We show that Contextual RAG consistently improves accuracy over standard RAG and base prompting, while maintaining competitive runtime and CO2 emissions. These results highlight the potential of Contextual RAG to serve as a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific Q&amp;A in ORAN and broader 5G/6G environments, enabling more accurate interpretation of evolving standards while preserving efficiency and sustainability.","Nathan Conger, Nathan Scollar, Kemal Davaslioglu, Yalin E.

Q-Regularized Generative Auto-Bidding: From Suboptimal Trajectories to Optimal Policies,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02754,"With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.","Mingming Zhang, Na Li, Zhuang Feiqing, Hongyang Zheng, Jiangbing Zhou, Wang Wuyin, Sheng-jie Sun, XiaoWei Chen, Junxiong Zhu, Lixin Zou, Chenliang Li"
EviRerank: Adaptive Evidence Construction for Long-Document LLM Reranking,https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06254,"Decoder-only LLM rerankers struggle with long documents: inference is costly and relevance signals can be diluted by irrelevant context. Motivated by an attention analysis indicating a consistent degradation trend when non-relevant text is appended, we propose EviRerank, an evidence-based long-document reranking framework for decoder-only LLMs. EviRerank (i) scores document blocks with a lightweight selector (BM25, bi-encoder, or cross-encoder), (ii) constructs a compact reranking context under a hard token cap by dynamically budgeting evidence blocks with Adaptive Evidence Budgeting (AEB) and adding a global summary cue via Summary Augmentation (SA), and (iii) reranks with a decoder-only LLM. Across TREC DL'19, DL'23, and MLDR-zh, EviRerank consistently outperforms full-document LLM reranking and strong block-selection baselines while substantially reducing the required input length. On TREC DL'19, EviRerank achieves 0.743 nDCG@10 and 0.307 MAP, establishing a new best result and improving over RankLLaMA (0.701/0.288) by +0.042 nDCG@10 (+6.0%) and +0.019 MAP (+6.6%).","Minghan Li, Eric Gaussier, Juntao Li, Guodong Zhou"
Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645,"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However, existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module, calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.","Hongyang Liu, Zhu Sun, Tianjun Wei, Yan Wang, Jiajie Zhu, Xinghua Qu"
LORE: A Large Generative Model for Search Relevance,https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03025,"Achievement. We introduce LORE, a systematic framework for Large Generative Model-based relevance in e-commerce search. Deployed and iterated over three years, LORE achieves a cumulative +27\% improvement in online GoodRate metrics. This report shares the valuable experience gained throughout its development lifecycle, spanning data, features, training, evaluation, and deployment. Insight. While existing works apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to enhance relevance, they often hit a performance ceiling. We argue this stems from treating relevance as a monolithic task, lacking principled deconstruction. Our key insight is that relevance comprises distinct capabilities: knowledge and reasoning, multi-modal matching, and rule adherence. We contend that a qualitative-driven decomposition is essential for breaking through current performance bottlenecks. Contributions. LORE provides a complete blueprint for the LLM relevance lifecycle. Key contributions include: (1) A two-stage training paradigm combining progressive CoT synthesis via SFT with human preference alignment via RL. (2) A comprehensive benchmark, RAIR, designed to evaluate these core capabilities. (3) A query frequency-stratified deployment strategy that efficiently transfers offline LLM capabilities to the online system. LORE serves as both a practical solution and a methodological reference for other vertical domains.","Chenji Lu (Alibaba Group), Zhuo Chen (Alibaba Group), Hui Zhao (Alibaba Group), Zhiyuan Zeng (Alibaba Group), Gang Zhao (Alibaba Group), Junjie Ren (Alibaba Group), Ruicong Xu (Alibaba Group), Haoran Li (Alibaba Group), Songyan Liu (Alibaba Group), Pengjie Wang (Alibaba Group), Jian Xu (Alibaba Group), Bo Zheng (Alibaba Group)"
CogCanvas: Verbatim-Grounded Artifact Extraction for Long LLM Conversations,https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00821,"Conversation summarization loses nuanced details: when asked about coding preferences after 40 turns, summarization recalls ""use type hints"" but drops the critical constraint ""everywhere"" (19.0% exact match vs. 93.0% for our approach).
  We present CogCanvas, a training-free framework inspired by how teams use whiteboards to anchor shared memory. Rather than compressing conversation history, CogCanvas extracts verbatim-grounded artifacts (decisions, facts, reminders) and retrieves them via temporal-aware graph.
  On the LoCoMo benchmark (all 10 conversations from the ACL 2024 release), CogCanvas achieves the highest overall accuracy among training-free methods (32.4%), outperforming RAG (24.6%) by +7.8pp, with decisive advantages on complex reasoning tasks: +20.6pp on temporal reasoning (32.7% vs. 12.1% RAG) and +1.1pp on multi-hop questions (41.7% vs. 40.6% RAG). CogCanvas also leads on single-hop retrieval (26.6% vs. 24.6% RAG). Ablation studies reveal that BGE reranking contributes +7.7pp, making it the largest contributor to CogCanvas's performance.
  While heavily-optimized approaches achieve higher absolute scores through dedicated training (EverMemOS: ~92%), our training-free approach provides practitioners with an immediately-deployable alternative that significantly outperforms standard baselines.

| Exploring Recommender System Evaluation: A Multi-Modal User Agent Framework for A/B Testing | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04554](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04554) | In recommender systems, online A/B testing is a crucial method for evaluating the performance of different models. However, conducting online A/B testing often presents significant challenges, including substantial economic costs, user experience degradation, and considerable time requirements. With the Large Language Models' powerful capacity, LLM-based agent shows great potential to replace traditional online A/B testing. Nonetheless, current agents fail to simulate the perception process and interaction patterns, due to the lack of real environments and visual perception capability. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-modal user agent for A/B testing (A/B Agent). Specifically, we construct a recommendation sandbox environment for A/B testing, enabling multimodal and multi-page interactions that align with real user behavior on online platforms. The designed agent leverages multimodal information perception, fine-grained user preferences, and integrates profiles, action memory retrieval, and a fatigue system to simulate complex human decision-making. We validated the potential of the agent as an alternative to traditional A/B testing from three perspectives: model, data, and features. Furthermore, we found that the data generated by A/B Agent can effectively enhance the capabilities of recommendation models.

| PROMISE: Process Reward Models Unlock Test-Time Scaling Laws in Generative Recommendations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04674](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04674) | Generative Recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, reformulating recommendation as a sequence-to-sequence generation task over hierarchical Semantic IDs. However, existing methods suffer from a critical issue we term Semantic Drift, where errors in early, high-level tokens irreversibly divert the generation trajectory into irrelevant semantic subspaces. Inspired by Process Reward Models (PRMs) that enhance reasoning in Large Language Models, we propose Promise, a novel framework that integrates dense, step-by-step verification into generative models. Promise features a lightweight PRM to assess the quality of intermediate inference steps, coupled with a PRM-guided Beam Search strategy that leverages dense feedback to dynamically prune erroneous branches. Crucially, our approach unlocks Test-Time Scaling Laws for recommender systems: by increasing inference compute, smaller models can match or surpass larger models. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests on a large-scale platform demonstrate that Promise effectively mitigates Semantic Drift, significantly improving recommendation accuracy while enabling efficient deployment. | Chengcheng Guo, Kuo Cai, Yu Zhou, Qiang Luo, Ruiming Tang, Han Li, Kun Gai, Guorui Zhou |
| ArtCognition: A Multimodal AI Framework for Affective State Sensing from Visual and Kinematic Drawing Cues | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04297](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04297) | The objective assessment of human affective and psychological states presents a significant challenge, particularly through non-verbal channels. This paper introduces digital drawing as a rich and underexplored modality for affective sensing. We present a novel multimodal framework, named ArtCognition, for the automated analysis of the House-Tree-Person (HTP) test, a widely used psychological instrument. ArtCognition uniquely fuses two distinct data streams: static visual features from the final artwork, captured by computer vision models, and dynamic behavioral kinematic cues derived from the drawing process itself, such as stroke speed, pauses, and smoothness. To bridge the gap between low-level features and high-level psychological interpretation, we employ a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This grounds the analysis in established psychological knowledge, enhancing explainability and reducing the potential for model hallucination. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of visual and behavioral kinematic cues provides a more nuanced assessment than either modality alone. We show significant correlations between the extracted multimodal features and standardized psychological metrics, validating the framework's potential as a scalable tool to support clinicians. This work contributes a new methodology for non-intrusive affective state assessment and opens new avenues for technology-assisted mental healthcare. | Behrad Binaei-Haghighi, Nafiseh Sadat Sajadi, Mehrad Liviyan, Reyhane Akhavan Kharazi, Fatemeh Amirkhani, Behnam Bahrak |

| Provenance Analysis of Archaeological Artifacts via Multimodal RAG Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20769](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20769) | In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models (VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological, geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications. We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of navigating vast comparative corpora. | Tuo Zhang, Yuechun Sun, Ruiliang Liu |
| FORGE: Forming Semantic Identifiers for Generative Retrieval in Industrial Datasets | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20904](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20904) | Semantic identifiers (SIDs) have gained increasing attention in generative retrieval (GR) due to their meaningful semantic discriminability. However, current research on SIDs faces three main challenges: (1) the absence of large-scale public datasets with multimodal features, (2) limited investigation into optimization strategies for SID generation, which typically rely on costly GR training for evaluation, and (3) slow online convergence in industrial deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FORGE, a comprehensive benchmark for FOrming semantic identifieR in Generative rEtrieval with industrial datasets. Specifically, FORGE is equipped with a dataset comprising 14 billion user interactions and multimodal features of 250 million items sampled from Taobao, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in China. Leveraging this dataset, FORGE explores several optimizations to enhance the SID construction and validates their effectiveness via offline experiments across different settings and tasks. Further online analysis conducted on our platform, which serves over 300 million users daily, reveals a 0.35% increase in transaction count, highlighting the practical impact of our method. Regarding the expensive SID validation accompanied by the full training of GRs, we propose two novel metrics of SID that correlate positively with recommendation performance, enabling convenient evaluations without any GR training. For real-world applications, FORGE introduces an offline pretraining schema that reduces online convergence by half.

| IntSR: An Integrated Generative Framework for Search and Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21179) | Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications. However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&amp;R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&amp;R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&amp;R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%). | Huimin Yan, Longfei Xu, Junjie Sun, Ni Ou, Wei Luo, Xing Tan, Ran Cheng, Kaikui Liu, Xiangxiang Chu |
| SwasthLLM: a Unified Cross-Lingual, Multi-Task, and Meta-Learning Zero-Shot Framework for Medical Diagnosis Using Contrastive Representations | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20567](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20567) | In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot, cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings. Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and 73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in low-resource contexts. | Ayan Sar, Pranav Singh Puri, Sumit Aich, Tanupriya Choudhury, Abhijit Kumar |
| Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151) | Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose \underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability. | Lei Hei, Tingjing Liao, Yingxin Pei, Yiyang Qi, Jiaqi Wang, Ruiting Li, Feiliang Ren |

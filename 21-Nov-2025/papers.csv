"OTCR: Optimal Transmission, Compression and Representation for Multimodal Information Extraction",https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14766,"Multimodal Information Extraction (MIE) requires fusing text and visual cues from visually rich documents. While recent methods have advanced multimodal representation learning, most implicitly assume modality equivalence or treat modalities in a largely uniform manner, still relying on generic fusion paradigms. This often results in indiscriminate incorporation of multimodal signals and insufficient control over task-irrelevant redundancy, which may in turn limit generalization. We revisit MIE from a task-centric view: text should dominate, vision should selectively support. We present OTCR, a two-stage framework. First, Cross-modal Optimal Transport (OT) yields sparse, probabilistic alignments between text tokens and visual patches, with a context-aware gate controlling visual injection. Second, a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) compresses fused features, filtering task-irrelevant noise to produce compact, task-adaptive representations. On FUNSD, OTCR achieves 91.95% SER and 91.13% RE, while on XFUND (ZH), it reaches 91.09% SER and 94.20% RE, demonstrating competitive performance across datasets. Feature-level analyses further confirm reduced modality redundancy and strengthened task signals. This work offers an interpretable, information-theoretic paradigm for controllable multimodal fusion in document AI.","Yang Li, Yajiao Wang, Wenhao Hu, Zhixiong Zhang, Mengting Zhang"
An LLM-Powered Agent for Real-Time Analysis of the Vietnamese IT Job Market,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14767,"Individuals entering Vietnam's dynamic Information Technology (IT) job market face a critical gap in reliable career guidance. Existing market reports are often outdated, while the manual analysis of thousands of job postings is impractical for most. To address this challenge, we present the AI Job Market Consultant, a novel conversational agent that delivers deep, data-driven insights directly from the labor market in real-time. The foundation of our system is a custom-built dataset created via an automated pipeline that crawls job portals using Playwright and leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) to intelligently structure unstructured posting data. The core of our system is a tool-augmented AI agent, based on the ReAct agentic framework, which enables the ability of autonomously reasoning, planning, and executing actions through a specialized toolbox for SQL queries, semantic search, and data visualization. Our prototype successfully collected and analyzed 3,745 job postings, demonstrating its ability to answer complex, multi-step queries, generate on-demand visualizations, and provide personalized career advice grounded in real-world data. This work introduces a new paradigm for labor market analysis, showcasing how specialized agentic AI systems can democratize access to timely, trustworthy career intelligence for the next generation of professionals.","Minh-Thuan Nguyen, Thien Vo-Thanh, Thai-Duy Dinh, Xuan-Quang Phan, Tan-Ha Mai, Lam-Son L\^e"
ExplainRec: Towards Explainable Multi-Modal Zero-Shot Recommendation with Preference Attribution and Large Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14770,"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities for recommendation systems, though current approaches such as TALLRec face challenges in explainability and cold-start scenarios. We present ExplainRec, a framework that extends LLM-based recommendation capabilities through preference attribution, multi-modal fusion, and zero-shot transfer learning. The framework incorporates four technical contributions: preference attribution tuning for explainable recommendations, zero-shot preference transfer for cold-start users and items, multi-modal enhancement leveraging visual and textual content, and multi-task collaborative optimization. Experimental evaluation on MovieLens-25M and Amazon datasets shows that ExplainRec outperforms existing methods, achieving AUC improvements of 0.7\% on movie recommendation and 0.9\% on cross-domain tasks, while generating interpretable explanations and handling cold-start scenarios effectively.","Bo Ma, LuYao Liu, ZeHua Hu, Simon Lau"
Multi-Aspect Cross-modal Quantization for Generative Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15122,"Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","Fuwei Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Dongbo Xi, Jishen Yin, Huan Chen, Peng Yan, Fuzhen Zhuang, Zhao Zhang"
ItemRAG: Item-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLM-Based Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15141,"Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been widely used as recommender systems, owing to their strong reasoning capability and their effectiveness in handling cold-start items. To better adapt LLMs for recommendation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been incorporated. Most existing RAG methods are user-based, retrieving purchase patterns of users similar to the target user and providing them to the LLM. In this work, we propose ItemRAG, an item-based RAG method for LLM-based recommendation that retrieves relevant items (rather than users) from item-item co-purchase histories. ItemRAG helps LLMs capture co-purchase patterns among items, which are beneficial for recommendations. Especially, our retrieval strategy incorporates semantically similar items to better handle cold-start items and uses co-purchase frequencies to improve the relevance of the retrieved items. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ItemRAG consistently (1) improves the zero-shot LLM-based recommender by up to 43% in Hit-Ratio-1 and (2) outperforms user-based RAG baselines under both standard and cold-start item recommendation settings.","Sunwoo Kim, Geon Lee, Kyungho Kim, Jaemin Yoo, Kijung Shin"
Unveiling Inference Scaling for Difference-Aware User Modeling in LLM Personalization,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15389,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, driving a growing demand for personalized outputs. Prior work has primarily leveraged a user's own history, often overlooking inter-user differences that are critical for effective personalization. While recent methods have attempted to model such differences, their feature extraction processes typically rely on fixed dimensions and quick, intuitive inference (System-1 thinking), limiting both the coverage and granularity of captured user differences. To address these limitations, we propose Difference-aware Reasoning Personalization (DRP), a framework that reconstructs the difference extraction mechanism by leveraging inference scaling to enhance LLM personalization. DRP autonomously identifies relevant difference feature dimensions and generates structured definitions and descriptions, enabling slow, deliberate reasoning (System-2 thinking) over user differences. Experiments on personalized review generation demonstrate that DRP consistently outperforms baseline methods across multiple metrics.","Suyu Chen, Yimeng Bai, Yulong Huang, Xiaoyan Zhao, Yang Zhang"
Beyond GeneGPT: A Multi-Agent Architecture with Open-Source LLMs for Enhanced Genomic Question Answering,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15061,"Genomic question answering often requires complex reasoning and integration across diverse biomedical sources. GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.
  In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.
  OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining. OpenBioLLM's modular multi-agent design reduces latency by 40-50% across benchmark tasks, significantly improving efficiency without compromising model capability. The results of our comprehensive evaluation highlight the potential of open-source multi-agent systems for genomic question answering.

HV-Attack: Hierarchical Visual Attack for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15435,"Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.","Linyin Luo, Yujuan Ding, Yunshan Ma, Wenqi Fan, Hanjiang Lai"
LLMDistill4Ads: Using Cross-Encoders to Distill from LLM Signals for Advertiser Keyphrase Recommendations,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03628,"E-commerce sellers are advised to bid on keyphrases to boost their advertising campaigns. These keyphrases must be relevant to prevent irrelevant items from cluttering search systems and to maintain positive seller perception. It is vital that keyphrase suggestions align with seller, search and buyer judgments. Given the challenges in collecting negative feedback in these systems, LLMs have been used as a scalable proxy to human judgments. This paper presents an empirical study on a major ecommerce platform of a distillation framework involving an LLM teacher, a cross-encoder assistant and a bi-encoder Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) student model, aimed at mitigating click-induced biases in keyphrase recommendations.","Soumik Dey, Benjamin Braun, Naveen Ravipati, Hansi Wu, Binbin Li"
A Hybrid Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Intelligent Fashion Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07573,"The rapid expansion of online fashion platforms has created an increasing demand for intelligent recommender systems capable of understanding both visual and textual cues. This paper proposes a hybrid multimodal deep learning framework for fashion recommendation that jointly addresses two key tasks: outfit compatibility prediction and complementary item retrieval. The model leverages the visual and textual encoders of the CLIP architecture to obtain joint latent representations of fashion items, which are then integrated into a unified feature vector and processed by a transformer encoder. For compatibility prediction, an ""outfit token"" is introduced to model the holistic relationships among items, achieving an AUC of 0.95 on the Polyvore dataset. For complementary item retrieval, a ""target item token"" representing the desired item description is used to retrieve compatible items, reaching an accuracy of 69.24% under the Fill-in-the-Blank (FITB) metric. The proposed approach demonstrates strong performance across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal learning for fashion recommendation.","Kamand Kalashi, Babak Teimourpour"
DiffuGR: Generative Document Retrieval with Diffusion Language Models,https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08150,"Generative retrieval (GR) re-frames document retrieval as a sequence-based document identifier (DocID) generation task, memorizing documents with model parameters and enabling end-to-end retrieval without explicit indexing. Existing GR methods are based on auto-regressive generative models, i.e., the token generation is performed from left to right. However, such auto-regressive methods suffer from: (1) mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation, e.g., an incorrect DocID token generated in early left steps would lead to totally erroneous retrieval; and (2) failure to balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy dynamically, which is crucial for practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, dubbed DiffuGR. It models DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process: during training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is learned to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR attempts to generate DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. In contrast to conventional left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR provides a novel mechanism to first generate more confident DocID tokens and refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising. Moreover, DiffuGR also offers explicit runtime control over the qualitylatency tradeoff. Extensive experiments on benchmark retrieval datasets show that DiffuGR is competitive with strong auto-regressive generative retrievers, while offering flexible speed and accuracy tradeoffs through variable denoising budgets. Overall, our results indicate that non-autoregressive diffusion models are a practical and effective alternative for generative document retrieval.","Xinpeng Zhao, Zhaochun Ren, Yukun Zhao, Zhenyang Li, Mengqi Zhang, Jun Feng, Ran Chen, Ying Zhou, Zhumin Chen, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Xin Xin"
MOON: Generative MLLM-based Multimodal Representation Learning for E-commerce Product Understanding,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11999,"With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless, achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges: the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2) effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.","Daoze Zhang, Chenghan Fu, Zhanheng Nie, Jianyu Liu, Wanxian Guan, Yuan Gao, Jun Song, Pengjie Wang, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng"

| Token-Controlled Re-ranking for Sequential Recommendation via LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17913) | The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as re-rankers is shifting recommender systems towards a user-centric paradigm. However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings. | Wenxi Dai, Wujiang Xu, Pinhuan Wang, Dimitris N.

| LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261) | Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases. | Shijun Li, Yu Wang, Jin Wang, Ying Li, Joydeep Ghosh, Anne Cocos |
| UFO: Unfair-to-Fair Evolving Mitigates Unfairness in LLM-based Recommender Systems via Self-Play Fine-tuning | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18342) | Large language model-based Recommender Systems (LRSs) have demonstrated superior recommendation performance by integrating pre-training with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, this approach introduces item-side unfairness. Existing studies primarily attribute this issue to the absence of fairness constraints during SFT and attempt to mitigate unfairness via re-weighting and re-ranking methods. In this paper, we find that unfairness arises not only from SFT but also from pre-training, where inherent biases are further amplified during SFT. This finding underscores the failure of current methods to address the root causes of unfairness. Moreover, current methods struggle to preserve satisfactory recommendation performance. To tackle these issues, we propose an Unfair-to-Fair evOlving (UFO) framework using a self-play mechanism, formulating unfairness mitigation as a two-player game. UFO alternates between two player roles: the \textit{judger}, which identifies unfairness from both pre-training and SFT, and the \textit{corrector}, which adjusts the LRS to address identified unfairness while preserving recommendation performance. Iterative optimization between these roles enables UFO to completely resolve unfairness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UFO effectively mitigates unfairness while improving recommendation performance. | Jiaming Zhang, Yuyuan Li, Xiaohua Feng, Zhifei Ren, Li Zhang, Chaochao Chen |
| Multimodal Large Language Models with Adaptive Preference Optimization for Sequential Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18740](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18740) | Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for sequential recommendation by enabling natural language reasoning over user behavior sequences. A common approach formulates recommendation as a language modeling task, where interaction histories are transformed into prompts and user preferences are learned via supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods operate solely in the textual modality and often miss users' fine-grained interests, especially when shaped by rich visual signals such as product images or movie posters. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by aligning text and vision in a shared semantic space. A prevalent training paradigm applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to model user preferences. Yet, two core challenges remain: 1) Imbalanced sample hardness, where random negative sampling causes overfitting on easy examples and under-training on hard ones; 2) Cross-modal semantic bias, where the fixed reference model in DPO prevents the policy model from correcting modality misalignments--especially over long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a Multimodal LLM framework that integrates Hardness-aware and Noise-regularized preference optimization for Recommendation (HaNoRec). Specifically, HaNoRec dynamically adjusts optimization weights based on both the estimated hardness of each training sample and the policy model's real-time responsiveness, prioritizing harder examples. It further introduces Gaussian-perturbed distribution optimization on output logits to enhance cross-modal semantic consistency and reduce modality bias inherited from the reference model. | Yu Wang, Yonghui Yang, Le Wu, Yi Zhang, Richang Hong |
| Generative Query Expansion with Multilingual LLMs for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19325](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19325) | Query expansion is the reformulation of a user query by adding semantically related information, and is an essential component of monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval used to ensure that relevant documents are not missed. Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources. | Olivia Macmillan-Scott, Roksana Goworek, Eda B. \"Ozyi\u{g}it |
| Leveraging Evidence-Guided LLMs to Enhance Trustworthy Depression Diagnosis | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17947](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17947) | Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis. | Yining Yuan, J.

| Path-Constrained Retrieval: A Structural Approach to Reliable LLM Agent Reasoning Through Graph-Scoped Semantic Search | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18313](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18313) | Large Language Model agents often retrieve context from knowledge bases that lack structural consistency with the agent's current reasoning state, leading to incoherent reasoning chains. We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information. These findings suggest that path-constrained retrieval is an effective approach for improving the reliability and coherence of LLM agent reasoning systems. | Joseph Oladokun |
| A Multimodal Conversational Agent for Tabular Data Analysis | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18405](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18405) | Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants. | Mohammad Nour Al Awad, Sergey Ivanov, Olga Tikhonova, Ivan Khodnenko |
| From Raw Features to Effective Embeddings: A Three-Stage Approach for Multimodal Recipe Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19176](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19176) | Recipe recommendation has become an essential task in web-based food platforms. A central challenge is effectively leveraging rich multimodal features beyond user-recipe interactions. Our analysis shows that even simple uses of multimodal signals yield competitive performance, suggesting that systematic enhancement of these signals is highly promising. We propose TESMR, a 3-stage framework for recipe recommendation that progressively refines raw multimodal features into effective embeddings through: (1) content-based enhancement using foundation models with multimodal comprehension, (2) relation-based enhancement via message propagation over user-recipe interactions, and (3) learning-based enhancement through contrastive learning with learnable embeddings. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that TESMR outperforms existing methods, achieving 7-15% higher Recall@10. | Jeeho Shin, Kyungho Kim, Kijung Shin |
| Inductive Generative Recommendation via Retrieval-based Speculation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02939](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02939) | Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm that tokenizes items into discrete tokens and learns to autoregressively generate the next tokens as predictions. While this token-generation paradigm is expected to surpass traditional transductive methods, potentially generating new items directly based on semantics, we empirically show that GR models predominantly generate items seen during training and struggle to recommend unseen items. In this paper, we propose SpecGR, a plug-and-play framework that enables GR models to recommend new items in an inductive setting. SpecGR uses a drafter model with inductive capability to propose candidate items, which may include both existing items and new items. The GR model then acts as a verifier, accepting or rejecting candidates while retaining its strong ranking capabilities. We further introduce the guided re-drafting technique to make the proposed candidates more aligned with the outputs of generative recommendation models, improving the verification efficiency. We consider two variants for drafting: (1) using an auxiliary drafter model for better flexibility, or (2) leveraging the GR model's own encoder for parameter-efficient self-drafting. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SpecGR exhibits both strong inductive recommendation ability and the best overall performance among the compared methods.

| GFlowGR: Fine-tuning Generative Recommendation Frameworks with Generative Flow Networks | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16114](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16114) | Generative recommendations (GR), which usually include item tokenizers and generative Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of scenarios. The majority of existing research efforts primarily concentrate on developing powerful item tokenizers or advancing LLM decoding strategies to attain superior performance. However, the critical fine-tuning step in GR frameworks, which is essential for adapting LLMs to recommendation data, remains largely unexplored. Current approaches predominantly rely on either the next-token prediction loss of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or recommendationspecific direct preference optimization (DPO) strategies. Both methods ignore the exploration of possible positive unobserved samples, which is commonly referred to as the exposure bias problem. To mitigate this problem, this paper treats the GR as a multi-step generation task and constructs a GFlowNets-based fine-tuning framework (GFlowGR). The proposed framework integrates collaborative knowledge from traditional recommender systems to create an adaptive trajectory sampler and a comprehensive reward model. Leveraging the diverse generation property of GFlowNets, along with sampling and heuristic weighting techniques, GFlowGR emerges as a promising approach to mitigate the exposure bias problem. Extensive empirical results on two real-world datasets and with two different GR backbones highlight the effectiveness and robustness of GFlowGR. | Yejing Wang, Shengyu Zhou, Jinyu Lu, Qidong Liu, Xinhang Li, Wenlin Zhang, Feng Li, Pengjie Wang, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng, Xiangyu Zhao |
| Conversational LLMs Simplify Secure Clinical Data Access, Understanding, and Analysis | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01053) | Large-scale clinical databases offer opportunities for medical research, but their complexity creates barriers to effective use. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), one of the world's largest open-source electronic health record databases, traditionally requires both SQL proficiency and clinical domain expertise. We introduce M3, a system that enables natural language querying of MIMIC-IV data through the Model Context Protocol. With a single command, M3 retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance or connects to hosted BigQuery, and allows researchers to pose clinical questions in plain English. We evaluated M3 using one hundred questions from the EHRSQL 2024 benchmark with two language models: the proprietary Claude Sonnet 4 achieved 94% accuracy, while the open-source gpt-oss-20B (deployable locally on consumer hardware) achieved 93% accuracy. Both models translate natural language into SQL, execute queries against MIMIC-IV, and return structured results alongside the underlying query for verification. Error analysis revealed that most failures stemmed from complex temporal reasoning or ambiguous question phrasing rather than fundamental architectural limitations. The comparable performance of a smaller open-source model demonstrates that privacy-preserving local deployment is viable for sensitive clinical data analysis. M3 lowers technical barriers to critical care data analysis while maintaining security through OAuth2 authentication, query validation, and comprehensive audit logging. | Rafi Al Attrach, Pedro Moreira, Rajna Fani, Renato Umeton, Amelia Fiske, Leo Anthony Celi |
| TBGRecall: A Generative Retrieval Model for E-commerce Recommendation Scenarios | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11977](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11977) | Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences, where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens, and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative recommendation systems for e-commerce applications. | Zida Liang (Shanghai Jiaotong University), Changfa Wu (Alibaba Inc), Dunxian Huang (Alibaba Inc), Weiqiang Sun (Shanghai Jiaotong University), Ziyang Wang (Alibaba Inc), Yuliang Yan (Alibaba Inc), Jian Wu (Alibaba Inc), Yuning Jiang (Alibaba Inc), Bo Zheng (Alibaba Inc), Ke Chen (Alibaba Inc), Silu Zhou (Alibaba Inc), Yu Zhang (Alibaba Inc) |
| DiffuGR: Generative Document Retrieval with Diffusion Language Models | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08150](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08150) | Generative retrieval (GR) re-frames document retrieval as a sequence-based document identifier (DocID) generation task, memorizing documents with model parameters and enabling end-to-end retrieval without explicit indexing. Existing GR methods are based on auto-regressive generative models, i.e., the token generation is performed from left to right. However, such auto-regressive methods suffer from: (1) mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation, e.g., an incorrect DocID token generated in early left steps would lead to totally erroneous retrieval; and (2) failure to balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy dynamically, which is crucial for practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, dubbed DiffuGR. It models DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process: during training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is learned to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR attempts to generate DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. In contrast to conventional left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR provides a novel mechanism to first generate more confident DocID tokens and refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising. Moreover, DiffuGR also offers explicit runtime control over the qualitylatency tradeoff. Extensive experiments on benchmark retrieval datasets show that DiffuGR is competitive with strong auto-regressive generative retrievers, while offering flexible speed and accuracy tradeoffs through variable denoising budgets. Overall, our results indicate that non-autoregressive diffusion models are a practical and effective alternative for generative document retrieval. | Xinpeng Zhao, Zhaochun Ren, Yukun Zhao, Zhenyang Li, Mengqi Zhang, Jun Feng, Ran Chen, Ying Zhou, Zhumin Chen, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Xin Xin |
| Align$^3$GR: Unified Multi-Level Alignment for LLM-based Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11255](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11255) | Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant advantages in leveraging structured world knowledge and multi-step reasoning capabilities. However, fundamental challenges arise when transforming LLMs into real-world recommender systems due to semantic and behavioral misalignment. To bridge this gap, we propose Align$^3$GR, a novel framework that unifies token-level, behavior modeling-level, and preference-level alignment. Our approach introduces: Dual tokenization fusing user-item semantic and collaborative signals. Enhanced behavior modeling with bidirectional semantic alignment. Progressive DPO strategy combining self-play (SP-DPO) and real-world feedback (RF-DPO) for dynamic preference adaptation. Experiments show Align$^3$GR outperforms the SOTA baseline by +17.8% in Recall@10 and +20.2% in NDCG@10 on the public dataset, with significant gains in online A/B tests and full-scale deployment on an industrial large-scale recommendation platform. | Wencai Ye, Mingjie Sun, Shuhang Chen, Wenjin Wu, Peng Jiang |
| Multi-Aspect Cross-modal Quantization for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15122](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15122) | Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in recommender systems. This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. | Fuwei Zhang, Xiaoyu Liu, Dongbo Xi, Jishen Yin, Huan Chen, Peng Yan, Fuzhen Zhuang, Zhao Zhang |
| The Challenge of Using LLMs to Simulate Human Behavior: A Causal Inference Perspective | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15524](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15524) | Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential to simulate human behavior. We identify a fundamental challenge in using them to simulate experiments: when LLM-simulated subjects are blind to the experimental design (as is standard practice with human subjects), variations in treatment systematically affect unspecified variables that should remain constant, violating the unconfoundedness assumption. Using demand estimation as a context and an actual experiment with 40 different products as a benchmark, we show this can lead to implausible results. While confounding may in principle be addressed by controlling for covariates, this can compromise ecological validity in the context of LLM simulations: controlled covariates become artificially salient in the simulated decision process. We show formally that confoundness stems from ambiguous prompting strategies. Therefore, it can be addressed by developing unambiguous prompting strategies through unblinding, i.e., revealing the experiment design in LLM simulations. Our empirical results show that this strategy consistently enhances model performance across all tested models, including both out-of-box reasoning and non-reasoning models. We also show that it is a technique that complements fine-tuning: while fine-tuning can improve simulation performance, an unambiguous prompting strategy makes the predictions robust to the inclusion of irrelevant data in the fine-tuning process. | George Gui, Olivier Toubia |
| Information Extraction From Fiscal Documents Using LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10659](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10659) | Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts. | Vikram Aggarwal, Jay Kulkarni, Aditi Mascarenhas, Aakriti Narang, Siddarth Raman, Ajay Shah, Susan Thomas |

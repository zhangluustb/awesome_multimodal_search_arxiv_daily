| CM$^3$: Calibrating Multimodal Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01226) | Alignment and uniformity are fundamental principles within the domain of contrastive learning. In recommender systems, prior work has established that optimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the objectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw together the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity mandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit hypersphere. This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within the context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among extant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our hypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment through a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with similar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within the hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity between items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution, thereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities within the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship between this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity function. Moreover, to enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce a Spherical B\'ezier method designed to integrate an arbitrary number of modalities while ensuring that the resulting fused features are constrained to the same hyperspherical manifold. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach over competing baselines. We also shown that the proposed methods can achieve up to a 5.4% increase in NDCG@20 performance via the integration of MLLM-extracted features.

| Why Generate When You Can Transform? Unleashing Generative Attention for Dynamic Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02050](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02050) | Sequential Recommendation (SR) focuses on personalizing user experiences by predicting future preferences based on historical interactions. Transformer models, with their attention mechanisms, have become the dominant architecture in SR tasks due to their ability to capture dependencies in user behavior sequences. However, traditional attention mechanisms, where attention weights are computed through query-key transformations, are inherently linear and deterministic. This fixed approach limits their ability to account for the dynamic and non-linear nature of user preferences, leading to challenges in capturing evolving interests and subtle behavioral patterns. Given that generative models excel at capturing non-linearity and probabilistic variability, we argue that generating attention distributions offers a more flexible and expressive alternative compared to traditional attention mechanisms. To support this claim, we present a theoretical proof demonstrating that generative attention mechanisms offer greater expressiveness and stochasticity than traditional deterministic approaches. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we introduce two generative attention models for SR, each grounded in the principles of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Diffusion Models (DMs), respectively. These models are designed specifically to generate adaptive attention distributions that better align with variable user preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our models significantly outperform state-of-the-art in both accuracy and diversity. | Yuli Liu, Wenjun Kong, Cheng Luo, Weizhi Ma |
| Evaluating User Experience in Conversational Recommender Systems: A Systematic Review Across Classical and LLM-Powered Approaches | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02096](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02096) | Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) are receiving growing research attention across domains, yet their user experience (UX) evaluation remains limited. Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly in adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23 empirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM.
  Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate, turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges, including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address these issues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for LLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices. | Raj Mahmud, Yufeng Wu, Abdullah Bin Sawad, Shlomo Berkovsky, Mukesh Prasad, A.

| Agentic Personalized Fashion Recommendation in the Age of Generative AI: Challenges, Opportunities, and Evaluation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02342](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02342) | Fashion recommender systems (FaRS) face distinct challenges due to rapid trend shifts, nuanced user preferences, intricate item-item compatibility, and the complex interplay among consumers, brands, and influencers. Traditional recommendation approaches, largely static and retrieval-focused, struggle to effectively capture these dynamic elements, leading to decreased user satisfaction and elevated return rates. This paper synthesizes both academic and industrial viewpoints to map the distinctive output space and stakeholder ecosystem of modern FaRS, identifying the complex interplay among users, brands, platforms, and influencers, and highlighting the unique data and modeling challenges that arise.
  We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a particularly critical task for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories. Our work shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of fashion consumers and brands. | Yashar Deldjoo, Nima Rafiee, Mahdyar Ravanbakhsh |
| From Generator to Embedder: Harnessing Innate Abilities of Multimodal LLMs via Building Zero-Shot Discriminative Embedding Model | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00955](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00955) | Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8 points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly reducing training time. | Yeong-Joon Ju, Seong-Whan Lee |
| DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance System using Knowledge Graphs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01136](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01136) | The operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of database systems is critical to ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&amp;M methods, including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&amp;M tasks (e.g., metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and cannot effectively incorporate literal O&amp;M experience (e.g., troubleshooting guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&amp;M system that combines reasoning LLMs with knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+) reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively. | Wei Zhou, Peng Sun, Xuanhe Zhou, Qianglei Zang, Ji Xu, Tieying Zhang, Guoliang Li, Fan Wu |
| MaRGen: Multi-Agent LLM Approach for Self-Directed Market Research and Analysis | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01370) | We present an autonomous framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate end-to-end business analysis and market report generation. At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer, Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants' presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7 minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to automatically create affordable market insights. | Roman Koshkin, Pengyu Dai, Nozomi Fujikawa, Masahito Togami, Marco Visentini-Scarzanella |
| I2CR: Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections for Multimodal Entity Linking | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02243](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02243) | Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections. This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task. When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%, 5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively.

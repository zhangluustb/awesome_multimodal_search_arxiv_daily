A Survey on Open Dataset Search in the LLM Era: Retrospectives and Perspectives,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00728,"High-quality datasets are typically required for accomplishing data-driven tasks, such as training medical diagnosis models, predicting real-time traffic conditions, or conducting experiments to validate research hypotheses. Consequently, open dataset search, which aims to ensure the efficient and accurate fulfillment of users' dataset requirements, has emerged as a critical research challenge and has attracted widespread interest. Recent studies have made notable progress in enhancing the flexibility and intelligence of open dataset search, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in addressing long-standing challenges in this area. Therefore, a systematic and comprehensive review of the open dataset search problem is essential, detailing the current state of research and exploring future directions. In this survey, we focus on recent advances in open dataset search beyond traditional approaches that rely on metadata and keywords. From the perspective of dataset modalities, we place particular emphasis on example-based dataset search, advanced similarity measurement techniques based on dataset content, and efficient search acceleration techniques. In addition, we emphasize the mutually beneficial relationship between LLMs and open dataset search. On the one hand, LLMs help address complex challenges in query understanding, semantic modeling, and interactive guidance within open dataset search. In turn, advances in dataset search can support LLMs by enabling more effective integration into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and data selection processes, thereby enhancing downstream task performance. Finally, we summarize open research problems and outline promising directions for future work. This work aims to offer a structured reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of open dataset search.","Pengyue Li, Sheng Wang, Hua Dai, Zhiyu Chen, Zhifeng Bao, Brian D. Davison"
CSRM-LLM: Embracing Multilingual LLMs for Cold-Start Relevance Matching in Emerging E-commerce Markets,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01566,"As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching (CSRM) framework, utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in successful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8% reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate.","Yujing Wang, Yiren Chen, Huoran Li, Chunxu Xu, Yuchong Luo, Xianghui Mao, Cong Li, Lun Du, Chunyang Ma, Qiqi Jiang, Yin Wang, Fan Gao, Wenting Mo, Pei Wen, Shantanu Kumar, Taejin Park, Yiwei Song, Vijay Rajaram, Tao Cheng, Sonu Durgia, Pranam Kolari"
Empowering Large Language Model for Sequential Recommendation via Multimodal Embeddings and Semantic IDs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02017,"Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations, respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner. Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/MME-SID.","Yuhao Wang, Junwei Pan, Xinhang Li, Maolin Wang, Yuan Wang, Yue Liu, Dapeng Liu, Jie Jiang, Xiangyu Zhao"
"Lighting the Way for BRIGHT: Reproducible Baselines with Anserini, Pyserini, and RankLLM",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02558,"The BRIGHT benchmark is a dataset consisting of reasoning-intensive queries over diverse domains. We explore retrieval results on BRIGHT using a range of retrieval techniques, including sparse, dense, and fusion methods, and establish reproducible baselines. We then apply listwise reranking with large language models (LLMs) to further investigate the impact of reranking on reasoning-intensive queries. These baselines are integrated into popular retrieval and reranking toolkits Anserini, Pyserini, and RankLLM, with two-click reproducibility that makes them easy to build upon and convenient for further development. While attempting to reproduce the results reported in the original BRIGHT paper, we find that the provided BM25 scores differ notably from those that we obtain using Anserini and Pyserini. We discover that this difference is due to BRIGHT's implementation of BM25, which applies BM25 on the query rather than using the standard bag-of-words approach, as in Anserini, to construct query vectors. This difference has become increasingly relevant due to the rise of longer queries, with BRIGHT's lengthy reasoning-intensive queries being a prime example, and further accentuated by the increasing usage of retrieval-augmented generation, where LLM prompts can grow to be much longer than ''traditional'' search engine queries. Our observation signifies that it may be time to reconsider BM25 approaches going forward in order to better accommodate emerging applications. To facilitate this, we integrate query-side BM25 into both Anserini and Pyserini.","Yijun Ge, Sahel Sharifymoghaddam, Jimmy Lin"
BALM-TSF: Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting,https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00622,"Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other, resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt, producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability to harness complementary information from text and time series.

Detecting LLM-assisted writing in scientific communication: Are we there yet?,https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16807,"Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have significantly reshaped text generation, particularly in the realm of writing assistance. While ethical considerations underscore the importance of transparently acknowledging LLM use, especially in scientific communication, genuine acknowledgment remains infrequent. A potential avenue to encourage accurate acknowledging of LLM-assisted writing involves employing automated detectors. Our evaluation of four cutting-edge LLM-generated text detectors reveals their suboptimal performance compared to a simple ad-hoc detector designed to identify abrupt writing style changes around the time of LLM proliferation. We contend that the development of specialized detectors exclusively dedicated to LLM-assisted writing detection is necessary. Such detectors could play a crucial role in fostering more authentic recognition of LLM involvement in scientific communication, addressing the current challenges in acknowledgment practices.","Teddy Lazebnik, Ariel Rosenfeld"
AlzheimerRAG: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation for Clinical Use Cases using PubMed articles,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16701,"Recent advancements in generative AI have fostered the development of highly adept Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate diverse data types to empower decision-making. Among these, multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications are promising because they combine the strengths of information retrieval and generative models, enhancing their utility across various domains, including clinical use cases. This paper introduces AlzheimerRAG, a Multimodal RAG application for clinical use cases, primarily focusing on Alzheimer's Disease case studies from PubMed articles. This application incorporates cross-modal attention fusion techniques to integrate textual and visual data processing by efficiently indexing and accessing vast amounts of biomedical literature. Our experimental results, compared to benchmarks such as BioASQ and PubMedQA, have yielded improved performance in the retrieval and synthesis of domain-specific information. We also present a case study using our multimodal RAG in various Alzheimer's clinical scenarios. We infer that AlzheimerRAG can generate responses with accuracy non-inferior to humans and with low rates of hallucination.","Aritra Kumar Lahiri, Qinmin Vivian Hu"
LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation,https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17966,"Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on modeling cross-domain preferences and capturing both intra- and inter-sequence item relationships. We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual and textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential recommendation systems. Our source code will be released.","Wangyu Wu, Zhenhong Chen, Xianglin Qiu, Siqi Song, Xiaowei Huang, Fei Ma, Jimin Xiao"
Interpretation Gaps in LLM-Assisted Comprehension of Privacy Documents,https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12225,"This article explores the gaps that can manifest when using a large language model (LLM) to obtain simplified interpretations of data practices from a complex privacy policy. We exemplify these gaps to showcase issues in accuracy, completeness, clarity and representation, while advocating for continued research to realize an LLM's true potential in revolutionizing privacy management through personal assistants and automated compliance checking.",Rinku Dewri
ST-Raptor: LLM-Powered Semi-Structured Table Question Answering,https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18190,"Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy.

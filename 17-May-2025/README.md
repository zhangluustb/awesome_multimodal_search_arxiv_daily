| A Survey on Large Language Models in Multimodal Recommender Systems | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09777](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09777) | Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) integrate heterogeneous user and item data, such as text, images, and structured information, to enhance recommendation performance. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context learning, and dynamic input handling. Compared to earlier pre-trained language models (PLMs), LLMs offer greater flexibility and generalisation capabilities but also introduce challenges related to scalability and model accessibility. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets, and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly evolving field. | Alejo Lopez-Avila, Jinhua Du |
| Do LLMs Memorize Recommendation Datasets? A Preliminary Study on MovieLens-1M | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10212) | Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more frequently than others.
  In this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization.

| Mitigating Modality Bias in Multi-modal Entity Alignment from a Causal Perspective | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19458](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19458) | Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to retrieve equivalent entities from different Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), a critical information retrieval task. Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios. | Taoyu Su, Jiawei Sheng, Duohe Ma, Xiaodong Li, Juwei Yue, Mengxiao Song, Yingkai Tang, Tingwen Liu |

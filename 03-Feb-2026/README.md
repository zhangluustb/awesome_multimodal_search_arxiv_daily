| Efficient Multilingual Search Relevance Modeling in E-Commerce via LLM Mixture-of-Experts | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00003](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00003) | In e-commerce platforms, search relevance directly influences both user experience and merchant revenue. In multi-country deployments, diverse linguistic, cultural, and product catalog contexts introduce significant distribution shifts, posing substantial challenges to relevance modeling. Existing approaches typically enhance the reasoning or multilingual abilities of a single monolithic model, yet they remain limited by data diversity, coverage gaps, and high inference costs in heterogeneous environments. Our empirical analysis reveals that different LLM base models exhibit complementary strengths across languages and regions, motivating an expert-based architecture. We propose a scalable LLM-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that dynamically routes queries to specialized experts and fuses their embeddings through concatenation. Among rule-based, pseudo-label-based, and fully end-to-end strategies, end-to-end hard routing with concatenation offers the best balance of effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate inference overhead, we further develop an engineering-optimized offline batch pipeline with resource-efficient scheduling, which hides memory latency, improves GPU utilization, and reduces GPU-hour consumption by up to 35% compared with synchronous execution. On datasets spanning six Southeast Asian markets, our MoE improves AUC by 0.72 percentage points over a dense baseline with the same active parameters. Meanwhile, the optimized pipeline achieves 27.6 queries per second (QPS), a 9% throughput improvement. These results demonstrate superior multilingual relevance and efficiency, delivering strong cost-effectiveness for real-world e-commerce search systems. | Ye Liu, Xu Chen, Wuji Chen, Mang Li |
| AutoBool: An Reinforcement-Learning trained LLM for Effective Automated Boolean Query Generation for Systematic Reviews | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00005](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00005) | We present AutoBool, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains large language models (LLMs) to generate effective Boolean queries for medical systematic reviews. Boolean queries are the primary mechanism for literature retrieval in this domain and must achieve high recall while maintaining reasonable precision - a challenging balance that existing prompt-based LLM approaches often struggle to achieve. A major limitation in this space is the lack of high-quality ground-truth Boolean queries for each topic, which makes supervised fine-tuning impractical. AutoBool addresses this challenge by using RL to directly optimize query generation with retrieval measures, without requiring target queries. To support this effort, we create and release the largest dataset of its kind: 65588 topics in total for training and evaluating the task of automatic Boolean query formulation. Experiments on our new dataset and two established datasets (CLEF TAR and Seed Collection) show that AutoBool significantly outperforms zero shot/few shot prompting and matches or exceeds the effectiveness of much larger GPT-based models (e.g., GPT-4o, O3) using smaller backbones. It also approaches effectiveness of expert-authored queries while retrieving 10 to 16 times fewer documents. Ablation studies reveal the critical roles of model backbone, size, decoding temperature, and prompt design.

| Towards Sample-Efficient and Stable Reinforcement Learning for LLM-based Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00632](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00632) | While Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) reasoning has shown promise in Large Language Models (LLMs), its adoption for enhancing recommendation quality is growing rapidly. In this work, we critically examine this trend and argue that Long CoT is inherently ill-suited for the sequential recommendation domain. We attribute this misalignment to two primary factors: excessive inference latency and the lack of explicit cognitive reasoning patterns in user behavioral data. Driven by these observations, we propose pivoting away from the CoT structure to directly leverage its underlying mechanism: Reinforcement Learning (RL), to explore the item space. However, applying RL directly faces significant obstacles, notably low sample efficiency-where most actions fail to provide learning signals-and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose RISER, a novel Reinforced Item Space Exploration framework for Recommendation. RISER is designed to transform non-learnable trajectories into effective pairwise preference data for optimization. Furthermore, it incorporates specific strategies to ensure stability, including the prevention of redundant rollouts and the constraint of token-level update magnitudes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that RISER significantly outperforms competitive baselines, establishing a robust paradigm for RL-enhanced LLM recommendation. Our code will be available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RISER/. | Hongxun Ding, Keqin Bao, Jizhi Zhang, Yi Fang, Wenxin Xu, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He |
| RecGOAT: Graph Optimal Adaptive Transport for LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Recommendation with Dual Semantic Alignment | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00682](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00682) | Multimodal recommendation systems typically integrates user behavior with multimodal data from items, thereby capturing more accurate user preferences. Concurrently, with the rise of large models (LMs), multimodal recommendation is increasingly leveraging their strengths in semantic understanding and contextual reasoning. However, LM representations are inherently optimized for general semantic tasks, while recommendation models rely heavily on sparse user/item unique identity (ID) features. Existing works overlook the fundamental representational divergence between large models and recommendation systems, resulting in incompatible multimodal representations and suboptimal recommendation performance. To bridge this gap, we propose RecGOAT, a novel yet simple dual semantic alignment framework for LLM-enhanced multimodal recommendation, which offers theoretically guaranteed alignment capability. RecGOAT first employs graph attention networks to enrich collaborative semantics by modeling item-item, user-item, and user-user relationships, leveraging user/item LM representations and interaction history. Furthermore, we design a dual-granularity progressive multimodality-ID alignment framework, which achieves instance-level and distribution-level semantic alignment via cross-modal contrastive learning (CMCL) and optimal adaptive transport (OAT), respectively. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the unified representations derived from our alignment framework exhibit superior semantic consistency and comprehensiveness. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks show that our RecGOAT achieves state-of-the-art performance, empirically validating our theoretical insights. Additionally, the deployment on a large-scale online advertising platform confirms the model's effectiveness and scalability in industrial recommendation scenarios.

| Towards Trustworthy Multimodal Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00730](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00730) | Recent advances in multimodal recommendation have demonstrated the effectiveness of incorporating visual and textual content into collaborative filtering. However, real-world deployments raise an increasingly important yet underexplored issue: trustworthiness. On modern e-commerce platforms, multimodal content can be misleading or unreliable (e.g., visually inconsistent product images or click-bait titles), injecting untrustworthy signals into multimodal representations and making existing recommenders brittle under modality corruption. In this work, we take a step towards trustworthy multimodal recommendation from both a method and an analysis perspective. First, we propose a plug-and-play modality-level rectification component that mitigates untrustworthy modality features by learning soft correspondences between items and multimodal features. Using lightweight projections and Sinkhorn-based soft matching, the rectification suppresses mismatched modality signals while preserving semantic consistency, and can be integrated into existing multimodal recommenders without architectural modifications. Second, we present two practical insights on interaction-level trustworthiness under noisy collaborative signals: (i) training-set pseudo interactions can help or hurt performance under noise depending on prior-signal alignment; and (ii) propagation-graph pseudo edges can also help or hurt robustness, as message passing may amplify misalignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones under varying corruption levels demonstrate improved robustness from modality rectification and validate the above interaction-level observations. | Zixuan Li |
| GRAB: An LLM-Inspired Sequence-First Click-Through Rate Prediction Modeling Paradigm | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01865](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01865) | Traditional Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) face increasing bottlenecks in performance and efficiency, often struggling with generalization and long-sequence modeling. Inspired by the scaling success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose Generative Ranking for Ads at Baidu (GRAB), an end-to-end generative framework for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction. GRAB integrates a novel Causal Action-aware Multi-channel Attention (CamA) mechanism to effectively capture temporal dynamics and specific action signals within user behavior sequences. Full-scale online deployment demonstrates that GRAB significantly outperforms established DLRMs, delivering a 3.05% increase in revenue and a 3.49% rise in CTR. Furthermore, the model demonstrates desirable scaling behavior: its expressive power shows a monotonic and approximately linear improvement as longer interaction sequences are utilized. | Shaopeng Chen, Chuyue Xie, Huimin Ren, Shaozong Zhang, Han Zhang, Ruobing Cheng, Zhiqiang Cao, Zehao Ju, Gao Yu, Jie Ding, Xiaodong Chen, Xuewu Jiao, Shuanglong Li, Liu Lin |
| Rethinking Generative Recommender Tokenizer: Recsys-Native Encoding and Semantic Quantization Beyond LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02338](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02338) | Semantic ID (SID)-based recommendation is a promising paradigm for scaling sequential recommender systems, but existing methods largely follow a semantic-centric pipeline: item embeddings are learned from foundation models and discretized using generic quantization schemes. This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

| From Prompt to Graph: Comparing LLM-Based Information Extraction Strategies in Domain-Specific Ontology Development | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00699](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00699) | Ontologies are essential for structuring domain knowledge, improving accessibility, sharing, and reuse. However, traditional ontology construction relies on manual annotation and conventional natural language processing (NLP) techniques, making the process labour-intensive and costly, especially in specialised fields like casting manufacturing. The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new possibilities for automating knowledge extraction. This study investigates three LLM-based approaches, including pre-trained LLM-driven method, in-context learning (ICL) method and fine-tuning method to extract terms and relations from domain-specific texts using limited data. We compare their performances and use the best-performing method to build a casting ontology that validated by domian expert. | Xuan Liu, Ziyu Li, Mu He, Ziyang Ma, Xiaoxu Wu, Gizem Yilmaz, Yiyuan Xia, Bingbing Li, He Tan, Jerry Ying Hsi Fuh, Wen Feng Lu, Anders E.

| LLM-based Embeddings: Attention Values Encode Sentence Semantics Better Than Hidden States | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01572](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01572) | Sentence representations are foundational to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. While recent methods leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive sentence representations, most rely on final-layer hidden states, which are optimized for next-token prediction and thus often fail to capture global, sentence-level semantics. This paper introduces a novel perspective, demonstrating that attention value vectors capture sentence semantics more effectively than hidden states. We propose Value Aggregation (VA), a simple method that pools token values across multiple layers and token indices. In a training-free setting, VA outperforms other LLM-based embeddings, even matches or surpasses the ensemble-based MetaEOL. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when paired with suitable prompts, the layer attention outputs can be interpreted as aligned weighted value vectors. Specifically, the attention scores of the last token function as the weights, while the output projection matrix ($W_O$) aligns these weighted value vectors with the common space of the LLM residual stream. This refined method, termed Aligned Weighted VA (AlignedWVA), achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free LLM-based embeddings, outperforming the high-cost MetaEOL by a substantial margin. Finally, we highlight the potential of obtaining strong LLM embedding models through fine-tuning Value Aggregation. | Yeqin Zhang, Yunfei Wang, Jiaxuan Chen, Ke Qin, Yizheng Zhao, Cam-Tu Nguyen |
| Trust by Design: Skill Profiles for Transparent, Cost-Aware LLM Routing | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02386](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02386) | How should Large Language Model (LLM) practitioners select the right model for a task without wasting money? We introduce BELLA (Budget-Efficient LLM Selection via Automated skill-profiling), a framework that recommends optimal LLM selection for tasks through interpretable skill-based model selection. Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models. Our framework enables practitioners to make principled and cost-performance trade-offs for deploying LLMs. | Mika Okamoto, Ansel Kaplan Erol, Glenn Matlin |
| Towards Next-Generation Recommender Systems: A Benchmark for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09382](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09382) | Recommender systems (RecSys) are widely used across various modern digital platforms and have garnered significant attention. Traditional recommender systems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making it difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an interactive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their evolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation assistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt templates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of personalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their capabilities. This is because commonly used datasets lack high-quality textual user queries that reflect real-world recommendation scenarios, making them unsuitable for evaluating LLM-based personalized recommendation assistants. To address this gap, we introduce RecBench+, a new dataset benchmark designed to access LLMs' ability to handle intricate user recommendation needs in the era of LLMs. RecBench+ encompasses a diverse set of queries that span both hard conditions and soft preferences, with varying difficulty levels. We evaluated commonly used LLMs on RecBench+ and uncovered below findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate preliminary abilities to act as recommendation assistants, 2) LLMs are better at handling queries with explicitly stated conditions, while facing challenges with queries that require reasoning or contain misleading information. Our dataset has been released at https://github.com/jiani-huang/RecBench.git. | Jiani Huang, Shijie Wang, Liang-bo Ning, Wenqi Fan, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Qing Li |
| Towards Context-aware Reasoning-enhanced Generative Searching in E-commerce | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16925](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16925) | Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines, validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation. | Zhiding Liu, Ben Chen, Mingyue Cheng, Enhong Chen, Li Li, Chenyi Lei, Wenwu Ou, Han Li, Kun Gai |
| MixLM: High-Throughput and Effective LLM Ranking via Text-Embedding Mix-Interaction | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07846](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07846) | Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing semantic nuances and therefore show impressive relevance ranking performance in modern recommendation and search systems. However, they suffer from high computational overhead under industrial latency and throughput requirements. In particular, cross-encoder ranking systems often create long context prefill-heavy workloads, as the model has to be presented with the user, query and item information. To this end, we propose MixLM, a novel LLM-based ranking framework, which significantly improves the system throughput via reducing the input context length, while preserving the semantic strength of cross-encoder rankers. In contrast to a standard ranking system where the context is presented to the model as pure text, we propose to use mix-interaction, a mixture of text and embedding tokens to represent the input. Specifically, MixLM encodes all items in the catalog into a few embedding tokens and stores in a nearline cache. The encoded item descriptions are used during online inference, effectively reducing the item length from a few thousand text tokens to a few embedding tokens. We share insights from deploying our MixLM framework to a real-world search application at LinkedIn, including a detailed discussion of our training pipelines, as well as a thorough analysis of our online serving infrastructure optimization. With the same latency budget and on-par relevance metrics, MixLM increased throughput by 10.0x comparing with strong baselines, 75.9x over full-text LLM rerankers. The efficiency gains delivered by MixLM enabled full-traffic deployment of LLM-powered search, which resulted in a significant 0.47\% increase in Daily Active Users (DAU) in online A/B tests. | Guoyao Li, Ran He, Shusen Jing, Kayhan Behdin, Yubo Wang, Sundara Raman Ramachandran, Chanh Nguyen, Jian Sheng, Xiaojing Ma, Chuanrui Zhu, Sriram Vasudevan, Muchen Wu, Sayan Ghosh, Lin Su, Qingquan Song, Xiaoqing Wang, Zhipeng Wang, Qing Lan, Yanning Chen, Jingwei Wu, Luke Simon, Wenjing Zhang, Qi Guo, Fedor Borisyuk |
| S$^2$GR: Stepwise Semantic-Guided Reasoning in Latent Space for Generative Recommendation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18664](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18664) | Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a transformative paradigm with its end-to-end generation advantages. However, existing GR methods primarily focus on direct Semantic ID (SID) generation from interaction sequences, failing to activate deeper reasoning capabilities analogous to those in large language models and thus limiting performance potential. We identify two critical limitations in current reasoning-enhanced GR approaches: (1) Strict sequential separation between reasoning and generation steps creates imbalanced computational focus across hierarchical SID codes, degrading quality for SID codes; (2) Generated reasoning vectors lack interpretable semantics, while reasoning paths suffer from unverifiable supervision. In this paper, we propose stepwise semantic-guided reasoning in latent space (S$^2$GR), a novel reasoning enhanced GR framework. First, we establish a robust semantic foundation via codebook optimization, integrating item co-occurrence relationship to capture behavioral patterns, and load balancing and uniformity objectives that maximize codebook utilization while reinforcing coarse-to-fine semantic hierarchies. Our core innovation introduces the stepwise reasoning mechanism inserting thinking tokens before each SID generation step, where each token explicitly represents coarse-grained semantics supervised via contrastive learning against ground-truth codebook cluster distributions ensuring physically grounded reasoning paths and balanced computational focus across all SID codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S$^2$GR, and online A/B test confirms efficacy on large-scale industrial short video platform. | Zihao Guo, Jian Wang, Ruxin Zhou, Youhua Liu, Jiawei Guo, Jun Zhao, Xiaoxiao Xu, Yongqi Liu, Kaiqiao Zhan |
| OneMall: One Architecture, More Scenarios -- End-to-End Generative Recommender Family at Kuaishou E-Commerce | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21770](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21770) | In the wave of generative recommendation, we present OneMall, an end-to-end generative recommendation framework tailored for e-commerce services at Kuaishou. Our OneMall systematically unifies the e-commerce's multiple item distribution scenarios, such as Product-card, short-video and live-streaming. Specifically, it comprises three key components, aligning the entire model training pipeline to the LLM's pre-training/post-training: (1) E-commerce Semantic Tokenizer: we provide a tokenizer solution that captures both real-world semantics and business-specific item relations across different scenarios; (2) Transformer-based Architecture: we largely utilize Transformer as our model backbone, e.g., employing Query-Former for long sequence compression, Cross-Attention for multi-behavior sequence fusion, and Sparse MoE for scalable auto-regressive generation; (3) Reinforcement Learning Pipeline: we further connect retrieval and ranking models via RL, enabling the ranking model to serve as a reward signal for end-to-end policy retrieval model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneMall achieves consistent improvements across all e-commerce scenarios: +13.01\% GMV in product-card, +15.32\% Orders in Short-Video, and +2.78\% Orders in Live-Streaming. OneMall has been deployed, serving over 400 million daily active users at Kuaishou. | Kun Zhang, Jingming Zhang, Wei Cheng, Yansong Cheng, Jiaqi Zhang, Hao Lu, Xu Zhang, Haixiang Gan, Jiangxia Cao, Tenglong Wang, Ximing Zhang, Boyang Xia, Kuo Cai, Shiyao Wang, Hongjian Dou, Jinkai Yu, Mingxing Wen, Qiang Luo, Dongxu Liang, Chenyi Lei, Jun Wang, Runan Liu, Zhaojie Liu, Ruiming Tang, Tingting Gao, Shaoguo Liu, Yuqing Ding, Hui Kong, Han Li, Guorui Zhou, Wenwu Ou, Kun Gai |
| Automated Archival Descriptions with Federated Intelligence of LLMs | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05711) | Enforcing archival standards requires specialized expertise, and manually creating metadata descriptions for archival materials is a tedious and error-prone task. This work aims at exploring the potential of agentic AI and large language models (LLMs) in addressing the challenges of implementing a standardized archival description process. To this end, we introduce an agentic AI-driven system for automated generation of high-quality metadata descriptions of archival materials. We develop a federated optimization approach that unites the intelligence of multiple LLMs to construct optimal archival metadata. We also suggest methods to overcome the challenges associated with using LLMs for consistent metadata generation. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our techniques, we conducted extensive experiments using a real-world dataset of archival materials, which covers a variety of document types and formats. The evaluation results demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques and highlight the superior performance of the federated optimization approach compared to single-model solutions in metadata quality and reliability. | Jinghua Groppe, Andreas Marquet, Annabel Walz, Sven Groppe |
| LLM-Based Multi-Agent Blackboard System for Information Discovery in Data Science | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01285](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01285) | Advances in large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities in data science, but their deployment is often limited by the challenge of finding relevant data in large data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: both single- and multi-agent systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files, and master-slave multi-agent systems rely on a rigid central controller that requires precise knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities, which is not possible in large-scale settings where the main agent lacks full observability over sub-agents' knowledge and competencies. We propose a novel multi-agent paradigm inspired by the blackboard architecture for traditional AI models. In our framework, a central agent posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents - either responsible for a partition of the data lake or retrieval from the web - volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design improves scalability and flexibility by removing the need for a central coordinator to know each agent's expertise or internal knowledge. We evaluate the approach on three benchmarks that require data discovery: KramaBench and modified versions of DSBench and DA-Code. Results show that the blackboard architecture substantially outperforms strong baselines, achieving 13%-57% relative improvements in end-to-end success and up to a 9% relative gain in data discovery F1 over the best baseline. | Alireza Salemi, Mihir Parmar, Palash Goyal, Yiwen Song, Jinsung Yoon, Hamed Zamani, Tomas Pfister, Hamid Palangi |

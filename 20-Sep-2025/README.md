| When Content is Goliath and Algorithm is David: The Style and Semantic Effects of Generative Search Engine | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14436](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14436) | Generative search engines (GEs) leverage large language models (LLMs) to deliver AI-generated summaries with website citations, establishing novel traffic acquisition channels while fundamentally altering the search engine optimization landscape. To investigate the distinctive characteristics of GEs, we collect data through interactions with Google's generative and conventional search platforms, compiling a dataset of approximately ten thousand websites across both channels. Our empirical analysis reveals that GEs exhibit preferences for citing content characterized by significantly higher predictability for underlying LLMs and greater semantic similarity among selected sources. Through controlled experiments utilizing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) APIs, we demonstrate that these citation preferences emerge from intrinsic LLM tendencies to favor content aligned with their generative expression patterns. Motivated by applications of LLMs to optimize website content, we conduct additional experimentation to explore how LLM-based content polishing by website proprietors alters AI summaries, finding that such polishing paradoxically enhances information diversity within AI summaries. Finally, to assess the user-end impact of LLM-induced information increases, we design a generative search engine and recruit Prolific participants to conduct a randomized controlled experiment involving an information-seeking and writing task. We find that higher-educated users exhibit minimal changes in their final outputs' information diversity but demonstrate significantly reduced task completion time when original sites undergo polishing. Conversely, lower-educated users primarily benefit through enhanced information density in their task outputs while maintaining similar completion times across experimental groups. | Lijia Ma, Juan Qin, Xingchen Xu, Yong Tan |
| What Matters in LLM-Based Feature Extractor for Recommender? A Systematic Analysis of Prompts, Models, and Adaptation | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979) | Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation. | Kainan Shi (Xi'an Jiaotong University), Peilin Zhou (Hong Kong University of Science,Technology), Ge Wang (Xi'an Jiaotong University), Han Ding (Xi'an Jiaotong University), Fei Wang (Xi'an Jiaotong University) |
| Music4All A+A: A Multimodal Dataset for Music Information Retrieval Tasks | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14891](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14891) | Music is characterized by aspects related to different modalities, such as the audio signal, the lyrics, or the music video clips. This has motivated the development of multimodal datasets and methods for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks such as genre classification or autotagging. Music can be described at different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level of artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect this aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to fill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a dataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All A+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level dataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image representations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums. Furthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows access to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item interaction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR tasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of granularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on multimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in missing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre classification in the movie domain. Our experiments show that images are more informative for classifying the genres of artists and albums, and that several multimodal models for genre classification struggle in generalizing across domains. We provide the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/hcai-mms/Music4All-A-A, the dataset is linked in the repository and provided open-source under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. | Jonas Geiger, Marta Moscati, Shah Nawaz, Markus Schedl |
| CSRM-LLM: Embracing Multilingual LLMs for Cold-Start Relevance Matching in Emerging E-commerce Markets | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01566](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01566) | As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching (CSRM) framework, utilizing a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) to address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in successful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8% reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate. | Yujing Wang, Yiren Chen, Huoran Li, Chunxu Xu, Yuchong Luo, Xianghui Mao, Cong Li, Lun Du, Chunyang Ma, Qiqi Jiang, Yin Wang, Fan Gao, Wenting Mo, Pei Wen, Shantanu Kumar, Taejin Park, Yiwei Song, Vijay Rajaram, Tao Cheng, Sonu Durgia, Pranam Kolari |
| jXBW: Fast Substructure Search for Large-Scale JSONL Datasets with LLM Applications | [https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12536](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12536) | JSON Lines (JSONL) is widely used for managing large collections of semi-structured data, ranging from large language model (LLM) prompts to chemical compound records and geospatial datasets. A key operation is substructure search, which identifies all JSON objects containing a query pattern. This task underpins applications such as drug discovery (querying compounds for functional groups), prompt engineering (extracting prompts with schema fragments), and geospatial analytics (finding entities with nested attributes). However, existing methods are inefficient: traversal requires exhaustive tree matching, succinct JSON representations save space but do not accelerate search, and XML-based approaches incur conversion overhead and semantic mismatches. We present jXBW, a compressed index for efficient substructure search over JSONL. jXBW introduces three innovations: (i) a merged tree representation that consolidates repeated structures, (ii) a succinct tree index based on the eXtended Burrows--Wheeler Transform (XBW), and (iii) a three-phase algorithm for substructure search. These enable query-dependent complexity, where cost depends on query characteristics rather than dataset size, while retaining succinct space. This resolves a key bottleneck in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems requiring structure-aware retrieval. Experiments on seven real datasets, including PubChem (1M compounds) and OSM geospatial data (6.6M objects), achieve up to 4,700$\times$ speedup over tree-based methods and over $6\times 10^6$ speedup relative to XML-based approaches. jXBW makes JSONL substructure search practical for the first time, opening opportunities for large-scale LLM-based analytics. | Yasuo Tabei |
